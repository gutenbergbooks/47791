alderman of London, moneyed the businesse; undertooke
it; and gott the profit and also the credit of that most
usefull invention, for which there<a name="FNanchor_3_212" id="FNanchor_3_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_212" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> ought to have been
erected a statue for the memory of this poore-man from

when I heard he was secretary to that learned prelate, who
made use of none but for merit. The Dr. told me that
when he presented his <i>Chronologie</i> to his
majestie King Charles the first, 'twas in the
matted gallery at White-hall<a name="FNanchor_III._4" id="FNanchor_III._4"></a><a href="#Footnote_III._4" class="fnanchor">[III.]</a>. The &lt;king&gt;
presently discerned the purpose of the treatise,
and turned to his owne birth; sayd the King,
'<i>Here's one lye to begin with</i>.' It seemes that
Mr. Isaacson had taken it out of ... (a foreigner), who
used the other account. Poor Mr. Isaacson was so ashamed
at this unlucky rencounter, that he immediately sneak't
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>away and stayd not for prayse or reward, both which perhaps
he might have had, for his majestie was well pleased with
it. He wrote severall little bookes, besides his <i>Chronologie</i>:
quaere of the minister's wife (his niece) their titles.
He was of Pembroke-hall, in Cambridge. He was there
about Master of Arts standing.</p>

<p>
Sir,<br />
</p>

<p>I find that my grandfather dyed in St. Cathrin Coleman's
parish London, the 19<sup>e</sup> January, 1620, and to my best
rememberance upon his gravestone in the chancell it was
ingraven that hee had lived in the said parrish 58 yeares.
He &lt;was&gt; fined for not serving the office of shereif of
London, being chosen in the yeare 1618.</p>

<p>My father died in St. Cathrin Coleman's parrish above-said
about the 7<sup>e</sup> of December, 1654, which is neare
34 years after my grandfather's death. I calculate from
the tyme of his birth to my grandfather's death to bee
39 yeares: ad<a name="FNanchor_10_219" id="FNanchor_10_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_219" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> the 34 yeares after my grandfather's death
to the 39 before: 39 + 34 makes 73 yeares his age&mdash;which
all the familie agree that hee was seaventy three yeares
of age when hee died, soe that hee was borne in anno 1581.
Borne in anno 1581, dyed aged 73, makes 1654 the yeare
when he dyed. And in all probabillity hee was borne
in St. Kathrin Coleman's parrish, my grandfather having
lived soe long tyme there: the church booke, if extant,
will soone resolve yow&mdash;I never heard any thing to the
contrary.</p>

<p>My brother William Isaacson could more exactly give
you an account of the degrees he tooke, if any, but the
University was Cambriege and the College Pembrooke-Hall.
I thinke I have heard hee was Mr. of Arts standing, but
am somthing uncertayne of this.</p>

<p>&lt;A life of 'James R.' is entered in the index to MS.
Aubrey 6 (see vol. i. p. 8), as contemplated by Aubrey. If
written, the life was hostile in tone, as may be seen from
the following query towards it (Aubrey, in MS. Wood
F. 39, fol. 347: 8 Sept. 1680):&mdash;</p>

<p>'Pray search that booke<a name="FNanchor_13_222" id="FNanchor_13_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_222" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>, and see if you can find the

<h3><b>David Jenkins</b> (1586-1663).</h3>


<p><a name="FNanchor_17_226" id="FNanchor_17_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_226" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>Judge Jenkins, prisoner in the Tower of London,
Windsor, etc., &lt;eleven&gt; yeares, for his loyalty. He would
have taken it kindly to have been made one of the judges
in Westminster Hall, but would give no money for it, [so<a name="FNanchor_18_227" id="FNanchor_18_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_227" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>
the Lord Chancellor Hyde never preferred him].</p>

<p>He was of very good courage. Rode in the lord Gerard's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>army in Pembrokeshire, in the forlorne-hope, with his long
rapier drawne holding it on-end.</p>

<p>Obiit Dec. 3, anno Domini 1663; sepult. at Cowbridge
church in the south aisle in Glamorganshire. No remembrance
yet (1682) set up for him.</p>

<p>[Quaere<a name="FNanchor_19_228" id="FNanchor_19_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_228" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> Sir Robert Thomas whereabout in the church

<p><a name="FNanchor_20_229" id="FNanchor_20_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_229" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>David Jenkins hath writt a learned treatise of the
lawe, in folio, of cases twice judged (quaere nomen); and
an 'opusculum' (<i>Lex terrae</i>, etc.) in 16mo.</p>

<p>Borne at ... in Glamorganshire. He was of Edmund
Hall. Afterwards of Graye's inne. One of the judges<a name="FNanchor_21_230" id="FNanchor_21_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_230" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>
in South Wales. Imprisoned a long time in the Tower,
Newgate, and Windsore. Was the only man that never
complied. Dyed about 1665, at Cowbridge in Glamorganshire.</p>

<p>He marryed Sir John Aubrey's sister.</p>

<p><a name="FNanchor_22_231" id="FNanchor_22_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_231" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>David Jenkins, judge, was borne at Hensol, the place
where he lived, in the parish of Pendeylwyn in com.
Glamorgan. He was reciting this verse out of Ausonius,
not long before he dyed, to Sir Llewellin Jenkins:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">Et baculo innitens, in qua reptabat arena.
</p>

<p>Scripsit Opuscula, contayning severall little treatises, viz.
Lex terrae, etc.; Rerum judicatarum censurae octo, in
folio; praeter alias ejusdem naturae ineditas.</p>

<p>He was one of the judges of the Carmarthen, Cardigan,
and Pembrokeshire circuit before the wars. In the warres
he was taken prisoner at Hereford. Long time prisoner
in the Tower, Newgate, Wallingford, and Windsore. Never
submitted to the usurping power (I thinke, the only man).
All his estate was confiscated; and was always excepted
by the parliament in the first ranke of delinquents.</p>

<p>In his circuit in Wales at the beginning of the warres,
he caused to be indicted severall men of those parts (that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>were parliament, etc. engaged against the king) for highe

when he was prisoner in Newgate, some of these grandees
came to him to triumph over him, and told him that if
they had been thus in his power, he would have hanged
them. 'God forbid els!' replied he&mdash;which undaunted
returne they much admired.</p>

<p>The parliament intended to have hanged him; and he
expected no lesse, but resolved to be hangd with the
Bible under one arme and Magna Charta under the other.
And hangd he had been, had not Harry Martyn told them
in the house that</p>

<p class="center">Sanguis martyrum est semen ecclesiae,
</p>

<p>and that that way would doe them more mischiefe. So
his life was saved, and they removed him out of the way
to Wallingford Castle.</p>

<p>He dyed upwards (something<a name="FNanchor_23_232" id="FNanchor_23_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_232" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>) of fowrscore yeares of

have been, he told me, if he would have given money
to the Chancellor&mdash;but he scornd it. He needed it not,
for he had his estate againe (1500 <i>li.</i> per annum), and
being old and carceribus confractus. Mr. T. H., Malmesburiensis,
told him one day at dinner that 'that hereafter

<h3><b>Sir Leoline Jenkins</b> (1623-1685).</h3>


<p><a name="FNanchor_27_236" id="FNanchor_27_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_236" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>Sir Lleuellin Jenkins, knight, was borne at Llantrithid
in the countie of Glamorgan, anno domini....</p>

<p>His father (whom I knew) was a good plaine countreyman,
a coppyholder of Sir John Aubrey, knight and baronet
(eldest son of Sir Thomas), whose mannour it is.</p>

<p>He went to schoole at Cowbridge, not far off.</p>

<p>David Jenkins, that was prisoner in the Tower (maried
a sister of Sir John Aubrey), was some remote kin to him;
and, looking on him as a boy towardly, diligent, and good,
he contributed something towards his education.</p>

<p>Anno Domini 164&lt;1&gt;, he was matriculated of Jesus
College in Oxford, where he stayed till (I thinke) he tooke
his degree of Bac. Artium.</p>

<p>About that time Sir John Aubrey sent for him home to
enforme his eldest sonne Lewis Aubrey (since deceased,
1659) in grammar; and that he might take his learning
the better, he was taught in the church-house where
severall boyes came to schoole, and there were 6 or 7
gentlemen's sonnes (Sir Francis Maunsell, bart.; Mr.
Edmund Thomas; Mr. ... ...) boarded in the towne.
The young gentlemen were all neer of an age, and ripe for
the University together; and to Oxford they all went
under Mr. Jenkins' care about anno 1649 or 50, but by
reason of the disturbances of those times, Sir John would
not have his sonne of any college. But they all studyed
at Mr. (now Sir) Sampson White's house, a grocer, opposite
to University College. Here he stayed with my cosen
about 3 yeares or better, and then, in anno 165- (vide
Mr. Hobbes' <i>de Corpore</i>, 'twas that yeare), he travelled
with my cosen and two or 3 of the other gentlemen into
France, where they stayd about 3 yeares and made themselves
masters of that language.</p>

<p>He first began<a name="FNanchor_28_237" id="FNanchor_28_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_237" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> the Civill lawe, viz., bought &lt;Arnold&gt;
Vinnius on Justinian, 1653<a name="FNanchor_29_238" id="FNanchor_29_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_238" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>

<p>When he brought home Mr. Lewis Aubrey, he returned
to Jesus College (quaere, if he was of the foundation).</p>

<p>After his majestie's restauration Dr. &lt;Francis&gt; Maunsell
was restored to his principallship of that house, but being
very old and wearie of worldly cares, he kept it not long,
before he resigned it to Mr. Jenkins.</p>

<p>Gilbert Sheldon, archbishop of Canterbury, and Sir John
Aubrey were <i>co-etanei</i>, and contracted a great friendship
at Oxon in their youth, which continued to their deaths.
In the troublesome times after Dr. Sheldon was expelled,
he was a yeare (I thinke) or two with Sir John at Llantrithid,
where he tooke notice of the vertue and assiduity of the
young man Mr. Jenkins. After the king's restauration
Sir John Aubrey recommended Mr. Jenkins to him; made
him. Anno &lt;1668&gt; he was archbishop of Canterbury:
Sir &lt;William&gt; Meyric, LL.D. and Judge of &lt;the Prerogative
Court of Canterbury&gt;, dyed, and the archbishop conferred
that place on Mr. Jenkins.</p>

<p>Anno ... he had the honour of knighthood.</p>

<p>Anno 1673, &lt;he&gt; was sent with Sir Joseph Williamson,
plenipotentiaries, to Nemeghen: I remember that
very time they went away was opposition of Saturn and
Mars. I sayd then to the earl of Th&lt;anet&gt; that if that
ambassade came to any good I would never trust to
astrologie again.</p>

<p>Anno 167- sent ambassador to ..., from whence he
returned anno 16[79/80].</p>

<p>March 25, 1680, he was made Principall Secretary of
Estate.&mdash;When I came to wayte on him to congratulate
for the honour his majestie had been pleased to bestowe
on him, he recieved me with his usuall courtesie, and sayd
that 'it had pleased God to rayse-up a poore worme to
doe his majestie humble service.'</p>

<p>He haz a strong body for study, indefatigable, temperate
and vertuous. God blesse him.</p>

<p>When Mary the queen-mother dyed at Paris, the king of
Fraunce caused her jewells and treasures to be locked up
and sealed. His majestie of Great Britaine sent Sir<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
Llewellin (which is Leoline in Latin) to Paris concerning
the administration [1668<a name="FNanchor_30_239" id="FNanchor_30_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_239" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>].</p>

<p>[Anthony<a name="FNanchor_39_248" id="FNanchor_39_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_248" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> Wood in his <i>Hist. &lt;et Antiq.
Univ. Oxon.&gt;</i>, lib. 2, p. 273, sayes he was
borne in Westminster: that (at riper yeares)
after he had studied at Cambridge he came
of his owne accord to Oxon and there entred
himselfe in Ch. Ch. and tooke his Master's
degree in Oxon (or conferred on him) anno 1619.]</p>

<p>His mother, after his father's death, maried a brick-layer;
and 'tis generally sayd that he wrought sometime
with his father-in-lawe<a name="FNanchor_40_249" id="FNanchor_40_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_249" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> (and particularly on the garden-wall
of Lincoln's Inne next to Chancery-lane&mdash;from old
parson &lt;Richard&gt; Hill, of Stretton, Hereff., 1646), and
that ... ..., a knight, a bencher, walking thro' and hearing
him repeat some Greeke verses out of Homer, discoursing
with him, and finding him to have a witt extraordinary,
gave him some exhibition to maintaine him at Trinity
college in Cambridge, where he was ... ... (quaere).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>

<p>Then he went into the Lowe-countreys, and spent some
time (not very long) in the armie<a name="FNanchor_41_250" id="FNanchor_41_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_250" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>, not to the disgrace
of ..., as you may find in his Epigrammes.</p>

<p>Then he came over into England, and acted and wrote,
but both ill, at the Green Curtaine, a kind of nursery or
obscure playhouse, somewhere in the suburbes (I thinke
towards Shoreditch or Clarkenwell)&mdash;from J. Greenhill.</p>

<p>Then he undertooke againe to write a playe, and did
hitt it admirably well, viz. 'Every man ...' which
was his first good one.</p>

<p>Serjeant John Hoskins, of Herefordshire, was his <i>father</i>.
I remember his sonne (Sir Bennet Hoskins, baronet, who
was something poeticall in his youth) told me, that when
he desired to be adopted his son: 'No,' sayd he, ''tis
honour enough for me to be your brother; I am your
father's son, 'twas he that polished me, I doe acknowledge
it.'</p>

<p>He was (or rather had been) of a clear and faire skin;
his habit was very plaine. I have heard Mr. Lacy, the
player, say that he was wont to weare a coate like a coach-man's
coate, with slitts under the arme-pitts. He would
many times exceed in drinke (Canarie was his beloved
liquour): then he would tumble home to bed, and, when
he had thoroughly perspired, then to studie. I have seen
his studyeing chaire, which was of strawe, such as old
woemen used, and as Aulus Gellius is drawen in.</p>

<p>When I was in Oxon, bishop Skinner (of Oxford), who
lay at our College, was wont to say that he understood
an author as well as any man in England.</p>

<p>He mentions in his Epigrammes a sonne that he had,
and his epitaph.</p>

<p>Long since, in King James' time, I have heard my
uncle Danvers say (who knew him), that he lived without
Temple Barre, at a combe-maker's shop, about the
Elephant and Castle. In his later time he lived in Westminster,
in the house under which you passe as you goe
out of the churchyard into the old palace; where he dyed.</p>

knew him very well, and says he was in the 6&ordm;, that is the
vpermost fforme in Westminster scole. At which time
his father dyed, and his mother marryed a brickelayer,
who made him (much against his will) to help him in his
trade. But in a short time, his scole maister, Mr. Camden,
got him a better imployment, which was to atend or
accompany a son of Sir Walter Rauleyes in his travills.
Within a short time after their returne, they parted (I
think not in cole bloud) and with a loue sutable to what
they had in their travills (not to be comended); and then,
Ben began to set up for himselfe in the trade by which
he got his subsistance and fame. Of which I nede not
giue any account. He got in time to haue a 100 <i>li.</i> a yeare
from the king, also a pention from the Cittie, and the
like from many of the nobilitie, and some of the gentry,
w<sup>h</sup> was well payd for loue or fere of his raling in verse
or prose, or boeth. My lord of Winton told me, he told
him he was (in his long retyrement, and sicknes, when he
saw him, which was often) much aflickted that hee had
profain'd the scripture, in his playes; and lamented it with
horror; yet, that at that time of his long retyrement, his
pentions (so much as came yn) was giuen to a woman that
gouern'd him, with whome he liud and dyed nere the Abie
in West mimster; and that nether he nor she tooke much
care for next weike, and wood be sure not to want wine;
of which he vsually tooke too much before he went to bed,
if not oftner and soner. My lord tells me, he knowes not,
but thinks he was borne in Westminster. The question
may be put to Mr. Wood very easily vpon what grownds
he is positiue as to his being borne their? he is a friendly
man and will resolue it. So much for brave Ben. You
will not think the rest so tedyus, as I doe this.</p>

<p>Harriott, this:&mdash;Mr. Warner did long and constantly lodg
nere the water-stares or market in Woolstable (Woolstable
is a place or lane not far from Charing Crosse, and nerer
to Northumberland howse). My lord of Winchester tells
me he knew him, and that he saide he first fownd out the
cerculation of the blood, and discover'd it &lt;to&gt; Do<sup>r</sup> Haruie
(who said that 'twas he (himselfe) that found it), for which
he is so memorably famose. Warner had a pention of
40 <i>li.</i> a yeare from that earle of Northumberland that lay
so long a prisner in the Towre, and som alowance from Sir
Tho. Alesbery with whome he vsually spent his sumer in
Windesor park, and was welcom, for he was harmless and
quet. His winter was spent at the Wolstable, where he
dyed in the time of the Parliament of 1640, of w<sup>ch</sup>, or
whome, he was no louer.</p>

<p>Mr. Harriott; my lord tells me, he knew him also: that
he was a more gentile man, then Warner. That he had
120 <i>li.</i> a yeare pention from the said earle (who was a louer
of ther studyes) and his lodging in Syon howse, where he
thinks, or beliues, he dyed.</p>

<h3><b>Ralph Kettell</b> (1563-1643).</h3>


<p><a name="FNanchor_56_265" id="FNanchor_56_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_265" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>Ralph Kettle, D.D., praeses Coll. Trin. Oxon., was
borne at &lt;King's Langley&gt; in Hertfordshire.</p>

<p>The lady Elizabeth Pope brought him in to be a
scholar of the house at eleaven yeares of age<a name="FNanchor_G_16" id="FNanchor_G_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_G_16" class="fnanchor">[G]</a> (as I have
heard Dr. Ralph Bathurst say).</p>

<p>I have heard Dr. Whistler<a name="FNanchor_57_266" id="FNanchor_57_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_266" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> say that he wrote good Latin,
and Dr. Ralph Bathurst (whose grandmother, ... Villers,
he maried), that he scolded the best in Latin of any one
that ever he knew. He was of an admirable healthy
constitution.</p>

<p>He dyed a yeare + after I came to the Colledge, and
he was then a good deale above 80 (quaere aetatem), and he
had then a fresh ruddy complexion. He was a very tall
well growne man. His gowne and surplice and hood being
on, he had a terrible gigantique aspect, with his sharp
gray eies. The ordinary gowne he wore was a russet
cloath gowne.</p>

<p>He was, they say, white<a name="FNanchor_58_267" id="FNanchor_58_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_267" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> very soon; he had a very
venerable presence, and was an excellent governour. One
of his maximes of governing was to keepe-downe the
<i>juvenilis impetus</i><a name="FNanchor_VI._12" id="FNanchor_VI._12"></a><a href="#Footnote_VI._12" class="fnanchor">[VI.]</a>. He was chosen President
anno Domini &lt;1598/9&gt; the second after the
foundation of the College.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_VI._12" id="Footnote_VI._12"></a><a href="#FNanchor_VI._12"><span class="label">[VI.]</span></a> 'Tis Seneca's
expression.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>

<p>He was a right Church of England man, and every
Tuesday, in terme time, in the morning, the undergraduates
(I have forgott if baccalaurs) were to come into the chapell
and heare him expound on the 36 Articles<a name="FNanchor_59_268" id="FNanchor_59_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_268" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> of the Church
of England. I remember he was wont to talke much
of the rood-loft, and of the wafers: he remembred those
times. On these dayes, if any one had committed a fault,
he should be sure to heare of it in the chapell before
his fellow collegiates.</p>

<p>&lt;On<a name="FNanchor_60_269" id="FNanchor_60_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_269" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> these days, he would be sure to&gt; have at him
that had a white cap on; for he concluded him to have
been drunke, and his head to ake. Sir<a name="FNanchor_61_270" id="FNanchor_61_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_270" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> John Denham
had borrowed money of Mr. Whistler, the recorder<a name="FNanchor_62_271" id="FNanchor_62_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_271" class="fnanchor">[62]</a>, and,
after a great while, the recorder askt him for it again.
Mr. Denham laught at it, and told him he never
intended that. The recorder acquainted the President,
who, at a lecture in the chapell, rattled him, and told him,
'Thy father,' (judge<a name="FNanchor_63_272" id="FNanchor_63_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_272" class="fnanchor">[63]</a>) 'haz hanged many an honester man.'
In my time, Mr. Anthony Ettrick and some others frighted
a poor young freshman of Magd. Hall with conjuring,
which when the old Dr. heard of: on the next Tuesday, sayd
he, 'Mr. Ettrick'&mdash;who is a very little man&mdash;'will conjure
up a jackanapes to be his great-grand-father.'</p>

<p>He sawe how the factious in religion in those dayes
drew, and he kept himselfe unconcerned. W. Laud,
archbishop of Canterbury, sent him one time a servant
of his with venison, which the old Dr. with much earnestnes
refused, and sayd that he was an old man, and his stomach
weake, and he had not eaten of such meate in a long time,
and by no meanes would accept of it; but the servant
was as much pressing it on him on the other side, and
told the President that he durst not carry it back<a name="FNanchor_64_273" id="FNanchor_64_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_273" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> againe.
Well, seing there was no avoyding it, the President asked the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>servant seriously, if the archbishop of Canterbury intended
to putt in any scholars or fellowes<a name="FNanchor_65_274" id="FNanchor_65_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_274" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> into his College?</p>

<p>Mr. ... ... one of the fellowes (in Mr. Francis
Potter's time) was wont to say, that Dr. Kettel's braine
was like a <i>hasty-pudding, where there was memorie, judgement,
and phancy all stirred together</i>. He had all these
faculties in great measure, but they were all just so
jumbled together. If you had to doe with him, taking
him for a foole, you would have found in him great
subtilty and reach: <i>&egrave; contra</i>, if you treated with him as
a wise man, you would have mistaken him for a foole. A
neighbour of mine (Mr. La&lt;urence&gt; St. Low<a name="FNanchor_H_17" id="FNanchor_H_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_H_17" class="fnanchor">[H]</a>) told me
he heard him preach once in St. Marie's Church, at Oxon.
He began thus: 'being my turne to preach in this place,
I went into my study to prepare my selfe for my sermon,
and I tooke downe a booke that had blew strings, and
look't in it,<a name="FNanchor_66_275" id="FNanchor_66_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_275" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>and 'twas sweet Saint Bernard. I chanced to
read such a part of it, on such a subject, which haz made
me to choose this text&mdash;&mdash;.' I know not whether this was
the only time or no that he used this following way
of conclusion:&mdash;'But now I see it is time for me to shutt
up my booke, for I see the doctors' men come-in wiping
of their beardes from the ale-house.'&mdash;(He could from the
pulpit plainly see them, and 'twas their custome in sermon
to go there, and about the end of sermon to returne to
wayte on their masters).</p>

<p>He had two wives, if not three, but no child (quaere).
His second wife was a Villiers, or rather (I thinke) the
widowe of ... Villers, esq., who had two beautifull daughters,
co-heires. The eldest, whom severall of good estate<a name="FNanchor_67_276" id="FNanchor_67_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_276" class="fnanchor">[67]</a>
would gladly have wedded, he would needs dispose of
himselfe, and he thought nobody so fitt a husband for
this angelique creature as one Mr. Bathurst, of the
College, a second brother, and of about 300 <i>li.</i> per annum,
but an indifferent scholar, red fac'd, not at all handsome.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>

<p>But the Doctor's fashion was to goe up and down the
college, and peepe in at the key-holes to see whether
the boyes did follow their books or no. He seldome
found Bathurst minding of his booke, but mending of
his old doublet or breeches. He was very thrifty and
penurious, and upon this reason he caried away this
curious creature. But she was very happy in her issue;
all her children were ingeniose and prosperous<a name="FNanchor_68_277" id="FNanchor_68_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_277" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> in the
world, and most of them beautifull.</p>

<p>About ... (neer 70 yeares since, I suppose,) one
Mr. Isham (elder brother to Sir Justinian Isham), a gentleman-commoner
of this howse, dyed of the small pox.
He was a very fine gentleman, and very well beloved by all
the colledge, and severall of the fellowes would have
preacht his funerall sermon, but Dr. Kettle would not
permitt it, but would doe it himselfe; which the fellowes
were sorry for, for they knew he would make a ridiculous
piece of worke of it. But preach the Dr. did: takes a
text and preaches on it a little while; and then takes
another text, for the satisfaction of the young gentleman's
mother; and anon he takes another text, for the satisfaction
of the young gentleman's grandmother. When
he came to the panegyrique, sayd he, 'He was the finest,
swet<a name="FNanchor_69_278" id="FNanchor_69_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_278" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> young gentleman; it did doe my heart good to see
him walke along the quadrangle. Wee have an old proverbe
that <i>Hungry dogges will eate dirty puddings</i>; but
I must needes say for this young gentleman,
that he always loved<a name="FNanchor_VII._13" id="FNanchor_VII._13"></a><a href="#Footnote_VII._13" class="fnanchor">[VII.]</a> <i>sweet</i>'&mdash;he spake it with
a squeaking voice&mdash;'things,'&mdash;and there was an end.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_VII._13" id="Footnote_VII._13"></a><a href="#FNanchor_VII._13"><span class="label">[VII.]</span></a> They were
wont to mock
me with this<a name="FNanchor_70_279" id="FNanchor_70_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_279" class="fnanchor">[70]</a>.</p></div>

<p>He observed that the howses that had the smallest
beer had most drunkards, for it forced them to goe into
the town to comfort their stomachs; wherfore Dr. Kettle
alwayes had in his College excellent beer, not better to be
had in Oxon; so that we could not goe to any other
place but for the worse, and we had the fewest drunkards
of any howse in Oxford.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>

<p>He was constantly at lectures and exercises in the
hall to observe them, and brought along with him his
hower-glasse; and one time, being offended at the
boyes, he threatned them, that if they would not doe
their exercise better he 'would bring an hower-glass two
howers long.'</p>

<p>He was irreconcileable to long haire; called them hairy
scalpes, and as for periwigges (which were then very
rarely worne) he beleeved<a name="FNanchor_71_280" id="FNanchor_71_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_280" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> them to be the scalpes of men
cutt off after they were hang'd, and so tanned and dressed
for use. When he observed the scolars' haire longer then
ordinary (especially if they were scholars of the howse),
he would bring a paire of cizers in his muffe (which he
commonly wore), and woe be to them that sate on the
outside of the table<a name="FNanchor_I_18" id="FNanchor_I_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_I_18" class="fnanchor">[I]</a>. I remember he cutt Mr. Radford's<a name="FNanchor_72_281" id="FNanchor_72_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_281" class="fnanchor">[72]</a>
haire with the knife that chipps the bread on the buttery-hatch,
and then he sang (this is in the old play&mdash;Henry
VIII&lt;'s time&gt;&mdash;of <i>Grammar<a name="FNanchor_73_282" id="FNanchor_73_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_282" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> Gurton's needle</i>)</p>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'And was not Grim the collier finely trimm'd?<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>'Mr.<a name="FNanchor_J_19" id="FNanchor_J_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_J_19" class="fnanchor">[J]</a> Lydall,' sayd he, 'how doe you decline <i>tondeo</i>?
Tondeo, tondes, tonedi?'</p>

<p>One time walking by the table where the Logick lecture
was read, where the reader was telling the boyes that a
syllogisme might be true <i>quoad formam</i>, but not <i>quoad
materiam</i>; said the President (who would putt-in sometimes),
'There was a fox had spyed a crowe upon a tree,
and he had a great mind to have him<a name="FNanchor_74_283" id="FNanchor_74_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_283" class="fnanchor">[74]</a>, and so getts under
the tree in a hope, and layes out his tayle crooked like
a horne, thinking the crowe might come and peck at it,
and then he would seise him. Now come we' (this<a name="FNanchor_75_284" id="FNanchor_75_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_284" class="fnanchor">[75]</a>
was his word), 'I say the foxe's tayle is a horne: is this
a true proposition or no?' (to one of the boyes). 'Yes,'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>sayd he (the Dr. expected he should have sayd No; for
it putt him out of his designe); 'Why then,' said he, 'take
him and toot him'; and away he went.</p>

<p>He dragg'd with one (i.e. right<a name="FNanchor_76_285" id="FNanchor_76_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_285" class="fnanchor">[76]</a>) foot a little, by which
he gave warning (like the rattlesnake) of his comeing.
Will. Egerton (Major-Generall Egerton's younger brother),
a good witt and mimick, would goe so like him, that sometime
he would make the whole chapell rise up, imagining
he had been entring in.</p>

<p>As they were reading of inscribing and circumscribing
figures, sayd he,'I will shew you how to inscribe a triangle
in a quadrangle. Bring a pig into the quadrangle, and
I will sett the colledge dog at him, and he will take the
pig by the eare; then come I and take the dog by the
tayle, and the hog by the tayle, and so there you have
a triangle in a quadrangle; <i>quod erat faciendum</i>.'</p>

<p>He preach't every Sunday at his parsonage at Garsington
(about 5 miles off). He rode on his bay gelding, with
his boy Ralph before him, with a leg of mutton (commonly)
and some colledge bread. He did not care for the countrey
revells, because they tended to debauchery. Sayd he, at
Garsington revell, 'Here is Hey for Garsington! and
Hey for Cuddesdon! and Hey Hockly! but here's nobody
cries, Hey for God Almighty!'</p>

<p>Upon Trinity Sunday (our festival day) he would
commonly preach at the Colledge, whither a number of
the scholars of other howses would come, to laugh at
him. In his prayer (where he was of course to remember
Sir Thomas Pope, our founder, and the lady Elizabeth
his wife, deceasd), he would many times make a willfull
mistake, and say, 'Sir Thomas Pope our <i>Confounder</i><a name="FNanchor_77_286" id="FNanchor_77_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_286" class="fnanchor">[77]</a>,'
but then presently recall himselfe.</p>

<p>He was a person of great charity. In his college, where
he observed diligent boyes that he ghessed had but a
slender exhibition from their friends, he would many times
putt money in at their windowes; that his right hand
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>did not know what his left did.<a name="FNanchor_78_287" id="FNanchor_78_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_287" class="fnanchor">[78]</a>Servitors that wrote
good hands he would sett on worke to transcribe for him
and reward them generosely, and give them good advise.
Mris. Howe, of Grendon, sent him a present of hippocris,
and some fine cheese-cakes, by a plain countrey fellow,
her servant. The Dr. tastes the wine:&mdash;'What,' sayd
he, 'didst thou take this drinke<a name="FNanchor_79_288" id="FNanchor_79_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_288" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> out of a ditch?' and
when he saw the cheese-cakes:&mdash;'What have we here,
<i>crinkum, crankum</i>?' The poor fellow stared on him, and
wondered at such a rough reception of such a handsome
present; but he shortly made him amends with a good
dinner and halfe-a-crowne. The parsonage of Garsington
(which belongs to the college) is worth ... per
annum, and this good old Doctor, when one of his parish<a name="FNanchor_80_289" id="FNanchor_80_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_289" class="fnanchor">[80]</a>,
that was an honest industrious man, happened by any
accident to be in decay and lowe in the world, would
let his parsonage to him for a yeare, two, or three, fourty
pounds a yeare under value.</p>

<p>In his younger yeares he had been chaplain to &lt;Thomas&gt;
Bilson, bishop of Winton.</p>

<p>In August, 1642, the lord viscount Say and Seale came
(by order of the Parliament) to visit the colleges, to see
what of new Popery they could discover in the chapells.
In our chapell, on the backside of the skreen, had been
two altars (of painting well enough for those times, and
the colours were admirably fresh and lively). That on
the right hand as you enter the chapell was dedicated
to St. Katharine, that on the left was of the taking our
Saviour off from the crosse. My lord Say sawe that this
was donne of old time, and Dr. Kettle told his lordship
'Truly, my Lord, we regard them no more then a dirty
dish-clout'; so they remained untoucht, till Harris's time<a name="FNanchor_81_290" id="FNanchor_81_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_290" class="fnanchor">[81]</a>,
and then were coloured over with green. The windowes
of the chapell were good Gothique painting, in every
columne a figure;&mdash;e.g. St. Cuthbert, St. Leonard, St.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>Oswald. I have forgott the rest. 'Tis pitty they should
be lost. I have a note of all the scutcheons in glasse
about the house. 'Twas pitty Dr. Bathurst tooke the
old painted glasse out of the library. Anciently, in the
chapell, was a little organ over the dore of the skreen.
The pipes were, in my time, in the bursery.</p>

<p><a name="FNanchor_82_291" id="FNanchor_82_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_291" class="fnanchor">[82]</a>Memorandum:&mdash;till Oxford was surrendred we sang
the reading psalmes on Sundayes, holy-dayes, and holy-day
eves; and one of the scholars of the house sang the ghospell
for the day in the hall, at the latter end of dinner, and concluded,
<i>Sic desinit Evangelium secundum beatum Johannem</i>
(or etc.): <i>tu autem, Domine, miserere nostri</i>.</p>

<p>He &lt;Kettle&gt; sang a shrill high treble; but there was
one (J. Hoskyns<a name="FNanchor_K_20" id="FNanchor_K_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_K_20" class="fnanchor">[K]</a>) who had a higher, and would play the
wag with the Dr. to make him straine his voice up to his.</p>

<p><a name="FNanchor_83_292" id="FNanchor_83_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_292" class="fnanchor">[83]</a>Memorandum:&mdash;there was in my time a rich pall<a name="FNanchor_84_293" id="FNanchor_84_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_293" class="fnanchor">[84]</a>
to lay on a coffin, of crimson velvet, with a large plaine
crosse on it of white silke or sattin.</p>

<p><a name="FNanchor_85_294" id="FNanchor_85_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_294" class="fnanchor">[85]</a>'Tis probable this venerable Dr. might have lived
some yeares longer, and finisht his century, had not those
civill warres come on: which much grieved him, that was
wont to be absolute in the colledge, to be affronted and
disrespected by rude soldiers. I remember, being at the
Rhetorique lecture in the hall, a foot-soldier came in and<a name="FNanchor_86_295" id="FNanchor_86_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_295" class="fnanchor">[86]</a>
brake his hower-glasse. The Dr. indeed was just stept
out, but Jack Dowch<a name="FNanchor_L_21" id="FNanchor_L_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_L_21" class="fnanchor">[L]</a> pointed at it. Our grove was the
Daphne for the ladies and their gallants to walke in, and
many times my lady Isabella Thynne<a name="FNanchor_VIII._14" id="FNanchor_VIII._14"></a><a href="#Footnote_VIII._14" class="fnanchor">[VIII.]</a> would
make her entrey with a theorbo or lute played
before her. I have heard her play on it in the grove
myselfe, which she did rarely; for which Mr. Edmund
Waller hath in his Poems for ever made her famous.
One may say of her as Tacitus sayd of Agrippina,
<i>Cuncta alia illi adfuere, praeter animum honestum</i>. She
was most beautifull, most humble, charitable, etc. but she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>could not subdue one thing. I remember one time this
lady and fine Mris. Fenshawe<a name="FNanchor_IX._15" id="FNanchor_IX._15"></a><a href="#Footnote_IX._15" class="fnanchor">[IX.]</a> (her great and
intimate friend, who lay at our college), would
have a frolick to make a visitt to the President.
The old Dr. quickly perceived that they came
to abuse him; he addresses his discourse to
Mris. Fenshawe, saying, 'Madam, your husband<a name="FNanchor_M_22" id="FNanchor_M_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_M_22" class="fnanchor">[M]</a> and father
I bred up here, and I knew your grandfather; I know
you to be a gentlewoman, I will not say you are a whore;
but gett you gonne for a very woman.' The dissolutenesse
of the times, as I have sayd, grieving the good
old Doctor, his dayes were shortned, and dyed &lt;July&gt;
anno Domini 1643, and was buried at Garsington: quaere
his epitaph.</p>

<p>Seneca's scholar Nero found fault with his style, saying

<p>I cannot forget a story that Robert Skinner, lord bishop
of Oxford, haz told us:&mdash;one Slymaker<a name="FNanchor_N_23" id="FNanchor_N_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_N_23" class="fnanchor">[N]</a>, a fellow of this
College long since, a fellow of great impudence, and little
learning&mdash;the fashion was in those dayes to goe, every
Satterday night (I thinke), to Joseph Barnes' shop, the
bookeseller (opposite to the west end of St. Mary's), where
the newes was brought from London, etc.&mdash;this impudent
clowne would alwayes be hearkning to people's whisperings
and overlooking their letters, that he was much taken
notice of. Sir Isaac Wake, who was a very witty man,
was resolved he would putt a trick upon him, and understood
that such a Sunday Slymaker was to preach at
St. Mary's. So Sir Isaac, the Saterday before, reades
a very formall lettre to some person of quality, that
cardinal Baronius was turned Protestant, and was marching
with an army of 40,000 men against the Pope. Slymaker
hearkned with greedy eares, and the next day in his prayer
before his sermon<a name="FNanchor_O_24" id="FNanchor_O_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_O_24" class="fnanchor">[O]</a>, beseeched God<a name="FNanchor_87_296" id="FNanchor_87_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_296" class="fnanchor">[87]</a>'of his infinite
mercy and goodnesse to give a blessing to the army of
cardinall Baronius, who was turnd Protestant, and now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
marching with an army of forty thousand men,' and so
runnes on: he had a Stentorian voice, and thunderd it
out. The auditors all stared and were amazed: ...
Abbot (afterwards bishop of Sarum<a name="FNanchor_88_297" id="FNanchor_88_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_297" class="fnanchor">[88]</a>) was then Vice-cancellor,
and when Slymaker came out of the pulpit,
sends for him, and asked his name: 'Slymaker,' sayd
he; 'No,' sayd the Vice-canc., ''tis <i>Lyemaker</i>.'</p>

<p>Dr. Kettle, when he scolded at the idle young boies
of his colledge, he used these names, viz. <i>Turds</i>, <i>Tarrarags</i>
(these were the worst sort, rude rakells), <i>Rascal-Jacks</i>,
<i>Blindcinques</i>, <i>Scobberlotchers</i> (these did no hurt, were sober,
but went idleing about the grove with their hands in their
pocketts, and telling the number of the trees there, or so).</p>

<p><a name="FNanchor_89_298" id="FNanchor_89_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_298" class="fnanchor">[89]</a>To make you merry I'le tell you a story that Dr.
Henry Birket<a name="FNanchor_90_299" id="FNanchor_90_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_299" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> told us tother day at his cosen &lt;Thomas&gt;
Mariet's, scilicet that about 1638 or 1640 when he was
of Trinity College, Dr. Kettle, preaching as he was wont
to doe on Trinity Sunday, told 'em that they should keepe
their bodies chast and holy: 'but,' said he, 'you fellows
of the College here eate good commons and drinke good
double-beer ... and that will gett-out.' How would the
good old Dr. have raunted and beat-up his kettle-drum,
if he should have seen such luxury in the College as there
is now! Tempora mutantur.</p>

of a good estate, and a strong and valiant person.</p>

<p>He was raunger of Woodstocke parke, and (I have heard
my old cosen Whitney say) would many times in his younger
yeares walke at nights in the parke with his keepers.</p>

<p>Sir Gerard Fleetwood succeeded him in this

<p>some person of quality had affronted him. So he spake
to Sir Henry Lee his heire to lie in wayte for him about
the Bell Inne in the Strand with halfe a dozen or more
lustie fellowes at his back and as the partie passed along
to give him a good blow with his cane and <i>whip and away</i>,
the tall fellowes should finish the revenge. Whether 'twere
nicety of conscience or cowardice, but Sir Henry the
younger absolutely refused it. For which he was disinherited,
and &lt;Sir Henry the elder&gt; setled his whole
estate upon a keeper's sonne of Whitchwood-forest of his
owne name, a one-eied young man, no kinne to him, from
whom the earle of Lichfield<a name="FNanchor_100_309" id="FNanchor_100_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_309" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> now is descended, as also

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span></p>

<p>He was never maried, but kept woemen to reade to him

his wife of Wotton. I have heard her daughter (who had
no more witt) glory what a brave reader her mother was
and how Sir Harry's worship much delighted to heare her.
But his dearest deare was Mris. Anne Vavasour. He
erected a noble altar monument of marble (&#9758; see it)
wheron his effigies in armour lay; at the feet was the effigies
of his mistresse Mris. Anne Vavasour. Which occasioned

<h3><b>William Lee</b> (15&mdash; -1610).</h3>


<p><a name="FNanchor_111_320" id="FNanchor_111_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_320" class="fnanchor">[111]</a>Mr. William Lee, A.M., was of Oxon<a name="FNanchor_112_321" id="FNanchor_112_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_321" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> (I thinke,
Magdalen Hall<a name="FNanchor_Q_27" id="FNanchor_Q_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_Q_27" class="fnanchor">[Q]</a>). He was the first inventor of the weaving
of stockings by an engine of his contrivance. He was a
Sussex man borne, or els lived there. He was a poor
curate, and, observing how much paines his wife tooke in
knitting a payre of stockings, he bought a stocking and a
halfe, and observed the contrivance of the stitch, which he
designed in his loome, which (though some of the appendent
instruments of the engine be altered) keepes the same to
this day. He went into France, and there dyed before his
loome was made there. So the art was, not long since, in
no part of the world but England. Oliver Protector made
an act that it should be felonie to transport this engine.
Vide Stowe's Chronicle and Baker's Chronicle, if any
mention of it. This information I tooke from a weaver
(by this engine) in Pear-poole lane, 1656. Sir John
Hoskyns, Mr. Stafford Tyndale, and I, went purposely
to see it.</p>

from whose mouth I have this information, tells me he was
of Oriel College in Oxon; he thinkes he was a fellowe.</p>

<p>He built that stately house at Ampthill in Bedfordshire
(now the earle of Alesbury's). He sent for the architects
from Italie.</p>

<p>He died at Burwell neer Lowth in Lincolnshire about
1656 or 1657, aged 92 yeares.</p>

<p>He was physitian to queen Anne (queen of king James).
See the list of the names of the physitians before <i>the
London dispensatorie</i>; as I remember, he was then president
of the Physitians' College at London.</p>

treatise in 4to for young beginners in the Mathematicks,
intituled</p>

<p>'Lucar solace, divided into fower bookes, which in part
are collected out of diverse authors in diverse languages,
and in part devised by Cyprian Lucar, gentleman. Imprinted
at London by Richard Field anno Domini 1590.'</p>

<p>It is dedicated 'to the right worshipfull his brother-in-law
Maister William Roe, esquier, and alderman of the
honorable citie of London.' This dedicatory epistle is
a well writ and close stile. He expresseth himselfe short
and cleare and to have been a publick-spirited and a good
man as well as learned and ingenious. He dates it 'From
my house in London the 1 day of May in the yeare of
the creation of the world 5552, and in the yeare of our
redemption 1590.'</p>

<p>The contents of the four bookes of Lucar Solace:&mdash;</p>

<p>'The first book containeth definitions of divers words
and terms, names and lengthes of divers English measures,
the true difference between an acar of land measured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
with a pearch of 12 foot, 18 foot, 20 foote, or 24 foote
in length, and an acar of land measured with a pearch
of 16 foot and an halfe foote in length, names and
types of divers geometrical instruments, names and
dwelling places of workmen which can make and doe
sell such instruments, meanes to discerne whether or no
the edge of a ruler is right, and infallible instructions by
which an ingenious reader may readily measure upon any
smooth table, drummes head, stoole or other superficies
measurable lengths, bredthes, heights, and depthes, apply
known lengthes, bredthes, heights, and depthes to many
good purposes, know recorded heighthes, lengthes, and
bredthes of some famous monuments in Sarum, in Westminster
and in the honorable citie of London, know the
antiquitie of the sayd citie of London, draw the true plat
of any place, make a fit scale for any platt or mappe,
reduce many plats into one fair mappe, reduce a mappe
from a bigge forme to a lesse forme, and from a lesse
forme to a bigge forme, and learne to know the commodities
and discommodities of places.</p>

<p><a name="FNanchor_140_349" id="FNanchor_140_349"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_349" class="fnanchor">[140]</a>'The second book sheweth how an ingenuous person
may measure a right-lined distance between any two
places described in a mappe, how he may measure the
circuite and superficiall content of any described peece of
land, how he may find the centre of any polygonon
equiangle figure, how he may find the center of any circle,
how he may make by a part of the circumference the
whole circumference agreeing unto that part, how he may
bring any right lined figure into triangles and how he may
know what number of angles in a right-lined figure are
equall to any certain number of right angles.</p>

<p>'The third book instructeth the reader to make any
triangle, square, or long-square, to erect a plumbe line
upon any part or point of a line, to divide any circle into
divers numbers of equall parts, to make any polygonon
equiangle figure, to make an egge-forme figure, to know
when a figure is inscribed within another figure or circum<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>scribed
about another figure, to inscribe certain rightlined
figures within certain other rightlined figures, to circumscribe
certain rightlined figures about certain other rightlined
figures, to divide a right line into so many equall parts
as he will, to tell whether a thing seen afar off doth stand
still, goe from him, or come towards him, to draw a line
equall to any assigned arch-line or to the whole circumference
of any assigned circle or to any assigned part of
a circle, to draw a circular line equall to any assigned right
line, to separate, lay out, and inclose within a long square,
one, two or three acars of land by diverse waies from any
peece of ground adjoyning, to change a figure of one forme
into an equall figure of another appointed forme, to make
a right line angle equall to a right line angle given, to
draw a parallel to a right line given, and to cube any
assigned sphere.</p>

<p>'The fourth booke teacheth the reader to know fruitfull
barren and minerall grounds, growthes ages and solid
contents of trees, and where a good air is. It doth also
teach the reader to build for the preservation of health, to
make a tunnell of a chimney so as no smoak shall annoy
him in his house, to fell timber and make sound boords
for buildings, to sink a well in due time and in a place
where water may be found, and to know whether a new
found spring of water will drie up in a hot and dry
summer; also it sheweth how water in a shallow well is
more wholesome than water in a deep well, how every
well ought to be uncovered<a name="FNanchor_141_350" id="FNanchor_141_350"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_350" class="fnanchor">[141]</a>and often times drawn drie,
how the use of water is necessary, how divers sorts of
water have divers qualities, how there are divers meanes
to trie among many sorts of water which water is best,
how great store of water may be thrown out of a new-devised
squerte upon any fired house or other thing, how
water may be brought in pipes or in gutters within the
ground to any appointed sesterne, how the depth of any
sea may be found, how the force of running waters which
weare away land may be broken; how wet grounds and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
bogges may be drained, and how by the art taught in
these 4 bookes the ingenuous reader may devise new
workes, strange engins and instruments not only for private
pleasure but also for sundry purposes in the common-wealth.'</p>

dyed.&mdash;He translated Dodantus' <i>Herball</i>, and writt a little
pamphlet, which I have, called '<i>The light of Britaine</i>,
being a short summary of the old English history,'
dedicated to queen Elizabeth.</p>

<p>He began the genealogy of king James, derived from
Brute; which his eldest son Thomas Lyte, of Lyte's-Cary
aforesaid, finished, and presented to king James. It is
most rarely donne and exquisitly limmed by a limmer&mdash;all
the kings' pictures, etc. King James, after it had hung
some time at Whitehal, ordered him to have it<a name="FNanchor_144_353" id="FNanchor_144_353"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_353" class="fnanchor">[144]</a>again
and to gett &lt;it&gt; ingraved, which was donne. Mr. Humble
of Pope's-head alley had the plates before the fire: I hope
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>they are not lost&mdash;it is most curiously donne, by Hole.
It is as big as the greatest map of England that ever
I sawe. Mr. Camden much admired, and at the foot writt
6 or 8 verses with his owne hand:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">

<span class="i0">Artificemne manum laudem celebremne labores,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lyte, tuos: hi namque docent delectat at illa,<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>etc.&mdash;which I have forgott.</p>

<p>T. Lyte writt the best print hand that ever I yet sawe.
The originall, which is now in the parlour at Lyte's-Cary,
was writt with his hand, and limmed by a famous artist.</p>

<h3><b>Henry Martin</b> (1602-1680).</h3>


<p><a name="FNanchor_157_366" id="FNanchor_157_366"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_366" class="fnanchor">[157]</a>Henry Martin, esq., son and heir of Sir Henry Martin,
knight, Judge of the Arches, was borne at &lt;Oxford&gt;.</p>

<p>Henry, the son, was of the university of &lt;Oxford<a name="FNanchor_158_367" id="FNanchor_158_367"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_367" class="fnanchor">[158]</a>&gt;;
travelled France, but never Italie. His father found out
a rich wife for him, whom he married something unwillingly.
He was a great lover of pretty girles, to whom
he was so liberall that he spent the greatest part of his
estate.</p>

<p>When he had found out a maried woman<a name="FNanchor_159_368" id="FNanchor_159_368"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_368" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> that he
liked (and he had his emissaries, male and female, to
looke out) he would contrive such or such a good
bargain, 20 or 30 <i>li.</i> per annum under rent, to have her neer
him. He lived from his wife a long time. If I am not
mistaken shee was sometime distempered by his unkindnesse
to her.</p>

<p>King Charles I had complaint against him for his
wenching. It happened that Henry was in Hyde-parke
one time when his majestie was there, goeing to see a race.
The king espied him, and sayd aloud, 'Let that ugly rascall
be gonne out of the parke, that whore-master, or els I will
not see the sport.' So Henry went away patiently, <i>sed
manebat alta mente repostum</i>. That sarcasme raysed the
whole countie of Berks against him<a name="FNanchor_160_369" id="FNanchor_160_369"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_369" class="fnanchor">[160]</a>: he<a name="FNanchor_161_370" id="FNanchor_161_370"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_370" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> was as far
from a Puritane as light from darknesse. Shortly after<a name="FNanchor_162_371" id="FNanchor_162_371"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_371" class="fnanchor">[162]</a>,
(1641) he was chosen knight of the shire of that county,
<i>nemine contradicente</i>, and proved a deadly enemy to the
king.</p>

<p>He was a great and faithfull lover of his countrey, and
never gott a farthing by the Parliament. He was of an
incomparable witt for reparte's; not at all covetous;
humble, not at all arrogant, as most of them were; a great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>cultor of justice, and did always in the house take the part
of the oppressed.</p>

<p>Anno 1660 he was obnoxious for having been one of the
late king's judges, and he was in very great danger to
have suffred as the others did (he pleaded only the king's
Act or Proclamation at Breda, which he shewd in his
hand), but (as he was a witt himselfe) so the lord Falkland
saved his life by witt, saying, 'Gentlemen, yee talke here
of makeing a sacrifice; it was the old lawe<a name="FNanchor_163_372" id="FNanchor_163_372"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_372" class="fnanchor">[163]</a>, all sacrifices
were to be without spott or blemish; and now you are
going to make an old rotten rascall a sacrifice.' This witt
tooke in the house, and saved his life.</p>

<p>He was first a prisoner at the Tower; then at Windsore
(removed from thence because he was an eie-sore to his
majestie etc.); from thence to Chepstowe, where he is now
(1680). During his imprisonment his wife relieved him
out of her joincture, but she dyed....</p>

<p>His stature was but midling; his habit moderate; his
face not good. Sir Edward Baynton was wont to say that
his company was incomparable, but that he would be
drunke too soon.</p>

<p>His speeches in the house were not long, but wondrous
poynant, pertinent, and witty. He was exceeding happy
in apt instances. He alone haz sometimes turned the
whole house. Makeing an invective speech one time
against old Sir Henry Vane, when he had don with him,
&lt;he&gt; said, <i>But for young Sir Harry Vane</i>&mdash;&mdash;and so sate
him downe. Severall cryed out&mdash;'What have you to say
to young Sir Harry?' He rises up: <i>Why! if young Sir
Harry lives to be old; he will be old Sir Harry!</i> and so
sate downe, and set<a name="FNanchor_164_373" id="FNanchor_164_373"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_373" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> the house a laughing, as he oftentimes
did.&mdash;Oliver Cromwell once in the house called him,
jestingly or scoffingly, '<i>Sir</i> Harry Martin.' H. M. rises
and bowes, 'I thanke <i>your majestie</i>, I alwayes thought
when you were <i>king</i>, that I should be knighted.'&mdash;A
godly member made a motion to have all profane and
unsanctified persons expelled the Houses. H. M. stood
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>up and moved that all the fooles might be putt out likewise,
and then there would be a thin house.&mdash;He was wont
to sleep much in the house (at least dog-sleepe): alderman
Atkins made a motion that such scandalous members as
slept and minded not the businesse of the house, should be
putt-out. H. M. starts up&mdash;'Mr. Speaker, a motion has
been to turne out the <i>Nodders</i>; I desire the <i>Noddees</i> may
also be turnd out.'&mdash;H. M. sayd that he had 'seen the
Scripture fulfilld&mdash;Thou hast exalted the humble and
meeke; thou hast filled the emptie with ... things, and
the rich hast thou sent emptie away.'&mdash;See a pretty speech
of his in print about the comeing in of the Scotts to assist
and direct us.</p>

<p><a name="FNanchor_165_374" id="FNanchor_165_374"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_374" class="fnanchor">[165]</a>Henry Martyn made the motion in the house to call
the <i>addressers</i> to account (viz. those that addressed to
Richard Cromwell, Protector, to stand by him with their
lives and fortunes), and that all the addressers that were
of it (of the house) might be turnd<a name="FNanchor_166_375" id="FNanchor_166_375"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_375" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> out as enemies to the
commonwealth of England and betrayers of their trust to
bring in government by a single person. Had not Dick
Cromwell sneak't away, then it is certaine that the Rump
would have cutt-off his head, as I am well assurd from
a deare friend<a name="FNanchor_167_376" id="FNanchor_167_376"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_376" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> of mine.</p>

When 'twas read Sir Henry Vane stood up and
repremanded and 'wondred at his impudence to affirme
such a notorious lye.' H. M., standing up, meekely
replied that 'there was a text had much troubled his spirit
for severall dayes and nights of the man that was blind

At the top of the picture is engraved 'Anno Dni 1620'; and round the
picture, 'Richardus Martinus, oraculum Londinense.' There are also the
following dedication and verses:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
'Viro illustri Lionello Cranfeildio, equiti aurato, Apothecae augustae (Guardarobam

<p><a name="Footnote_W_36" id="Footnote_W_36"></a><a href="#FNanchor_W_36"><span class="label">[W]</span></a> Anthony Wood has written at the top of fol. 96 of the MS., 'see in
Trin. Coll.'; i.e. in his own <i>Hist. et Antiq. Univ. Oxon.</i> (1674), lib. II. pag.
296. Also, on a slip attached here, Wood notes:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
'Mr. Isaac of Exeter hath told me that Richard Martin, recorder of London,
was son of Richard Martin, merchant, of Exeter: see G. 1. So this last
Richard Martin, borne in Somerset, cannot be he; and he that was borne in
Devonshire
</p>
<p>
(lib. matric. P, p. 496 &lt;Broadgates Hall&gt;;&mdash;Dec. 10, 1585, Rich. Martin,
Devon., generosae conditionis filius, aet. 15)
</p>
<p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_X_37" id="Footnote_X_37"></a><a href="#FNanchor_X_37"><span class="label">[X]</span></a> An echo of a symposium in which this Richard Martin and other 'jolly
companions' took part lingers in a copy of Macaronic verses by John Hoskyns
(see i. 416). I give them here from the copy on fol. 185<sup>v</sup> of an old common-place
book in Lincoln College Library. Falconer Madan, Esq., Fellow of
Brasenose, has another old copy, with an English version, which by his
kindness I am able to add. The title of it in the Lincoln MS. is&mdash;
</p>
<p>
'<i>Convivium philosophicum</i>: tentum in clauso Termini S<sup>ti</sup>. Micha&euml;lis in
crastino<a name="FNanchor_181_390" id="FNanchor_181_390"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_390" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> festi S<sup>ti</sup>. Egidii in campis, authore Rodolpho Calsabro, Aeneacensi.'
</p>
<p>
But in Mr. Madan's MS. it is headed,
</p>
<p>
'Mr. Hoskins, his Convivium Philosophicum,'
</p>
<p>
and this attribution of authorship is repeated at the end of the piece.
</p>
<p>
The <i>Convivium</i> itself must have taken place between 1608 (Tom Coryat's
European tour) and 1612 (Henry, Prince of Wales, died November 6).

<h3><b>Andrew Marvel</b> (1620-1678).</h3>


<p><a name="FNanchor_201_410" id="FNanchor_201_410"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_410" class="fnanchor">[201]</a>Mr. Andrew Marvell: his father was minister of ...
(I thinke, Hull: quaere) ..., he was borne.</p>

<p>He had good grammar-education: and was after sent to ...,
in Cambridge.</p>

<p>In the time of Oliver the Protector he was Latin
Secretarie. He was a great master of the Latin tongue;
an excellent poet in Latin or English: for Latin verses
there was no man could come into competition with him.
The verses called <i>The Advice to the Painter</i> were of his
making.</p>

<p>His native towne of Hull loved him so well that they
elected him for their representative in Parliament, and gave
him an honourable pension to maintaine him.</p>

<p>He was of a middling stature, pretty strong
sett, roundish faced, cherry cheek't, hazell eie,
browne haire. He was in his conversation very
modest, and of very few words<a name="FNanchor_202_411" id="FNanchor_202_411"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_411" class="fnanchor">[202]</a>: and though
he loved wine he would never drinke hard in
company, and was<a name="FNanchor_XIV._38" id="FNanchor_XIV._38"></a><a href="#Footnote_XIV._38" class="fnanchor">[XIV.]</a> wont to say that, <i>he would not play the</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span><i>good-fellow in any man's company in whose hands he would
not trust his life</i>.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_XIV._38" id="Footnote_XIV._38"></a><a href="#FNanchor_XIV._38"><span class="label">[XIV.]</span></a> He was wont
to say that he
would not
drinke high or
freely with any
man with whom
he would not
intrust his life.</p></div>

<p>He kept bottles of wine at his lodgeing, and many times
he would drinke liberally by himselfe to refresh his spirits,
and exalt his muse. I remember I have been told (Mr.
Haake and Dr. Pell) that the learned ... (an High-German)
was wont to keep bottells of good Rhenish-wine
in his studie, and when he had spent his spirits he would
drinke a good rummer of it.</p>

<p>James Harrington, esq. (autor <i>Oceanae</i>), was his intimate
friend. John Pell, D.D., was one of his acquaintance. He
had not a generall acquaintance.</p>

<p>He wrote <i>The Rehersall transprosed</i>, against Samuel
Parker, D.D.; <i>Mr. Smirke</i>, (stich't, 4to, about 8 sheets);
<i>The naked Trueth</i>.</p>

<p>Obiit Londini, Aug. 18. 1678; and is buried in St. Giles
church in-the-fields about the middle (quaere iterum) of
the south aisle. Some suspect that he was poysoned by
the Jesuites, but I cannot be positive.</p>

<p>I remember I heard him say that the earle of Rochester<a name="FNanchor_203_412" id="FNanchor_203_412"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_412" class="fnanchor">[203]</a>
was the only man in England that had the true veine of
satyre.</p>

<p>He<a name="FNanchor_204_413" id="FNanchor_204_413"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_413" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> lies interred under the pewes in the south side of
Saint Giles' church in-the-fields, under the window wherein
is painted in glasse a red lyon, (it was given by the
inneholder of the Red Lyon Inne in Holborne) and is the ...
window from the east. This account I had from the
sexton that made his grave.</p>

<h3><b>Philip Massinger</b> (1584?-1639/40).</h3>


<p><a name="FNanchor_205_414" id="FNanchor_205_414"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_414" class="fnanchor">[205]</a>My brother Tom searcht the register of Wilton
from the beginning and talk't with old men. Philip
Massinger was not buried there; but his wife dyed at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>Cardiffe in Wales, to whom the earl of Pembroke payd
an annuity.</p>

<p><a name="FNanchor_206_415" id="FNanchor_206_415"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_415" class="fnanchor">[206]</a>This day I searched the register of St. Saviour's,
Southwark, by the playhouse then there, vulgo St. Mary's
Overy's; and find Philip Massinger buryed March 18th,
1639. I am enformed at the place where he dyed, which
was by the Bankes side neer the then playhouse, that he
was buryed about the middle of the Bullhead-churchyard&mdash;i.e.
that churchyard (for there are four) which is next the
Bullhead taverne, from whence it has its denomination.
He dyed about the 66th yeare of his age: went to bed
well, and dyed suddenly&mdash;but not of the plague.</p>

Philip Melancthon was his great-grandmother's brother.</p>

<p>He is of little stature, perfect; black haire, of a delicate

He is of a soft temper, of great temperance (amat Venerem
aliquantum): of a prodigious invention, and will be
acquainted (familiarly) with nobody. His true German
name is Nicolas Kauffman, i.e. chapman, i.e. Mercator.</p>

<p>The first booke he printed was his <i>Cosmographia</i>, at ...,
where he uses his German name, 'qua sternitur fundamentum

<p>Memorandum:&mdash;Mr. Nicholas Mercator made and presented
to King Charles the 2<sup>d</sup> a clock ('twas of a foote
diameter) which shewed the inequality of the sunn's motion
from the apparent motion, which the king did understand
by his informations, and did commend it, but he never had
a penny of him for it.</p>

<p>Well! This curious clock was neglected, and somebody
of the court happened to become master of it, who under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>stood
it not; he sold it to Mr. Knib, a watch-maker, who
did not understand it neither, who sold it to Mr. Fromantle
(that made it) for 5 <i>li.</i> who askes now (1683) for it 200 <i>li.</i></p>

<p>Anno 1682, mense Febr., Mr. N. Mercator left London;
went with his family to Paris, being invited thither by

<h3><b>John Milton</b> (1608-1674).</h3>


<div class="blockquot">

<p>&lt;This life is found in MS. Aubr. 8, foll. 63-68<sup>v</sup>. Aubrey's notes for
it were at first very slight, but were increased by information after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>wards
obtained from Milton's widow, from his brother Christopher,
and from his nephew Edward Phillips. In the life as now printed
these later notes, brought in very disjointedly into the MS., have been
set in their proper places.</p>

<p>When he first began writing his 'Lives,' Aubrey set aside fol. 103<sup>v</sup>
of MS. Aubr. 6 (opposite the life of Andrew Marvell) for Milton,
writing the heading 'Mr. John Milton' and in the margin drawing a
wreath of laurel, for a poet. Afterwards he scored the heading out,
and added the reference, 'vide part iii<sup>d</sup>.' i.e. MS. Aubr. 8. Again, in
MS. Aubr. 8, he at first set aside fol. 93 for the life of 'Mr. John
Milton,' but afterwards scored the heading out, and wrote there the
life of Dr. John Overall.</p>

<p>In MS. Aubr. 8, fol. 63, Aubrey gives in trick the coat for Milton:&mdash;'argent,
a double-headed eagle displayed gules legged and beaked
sable: crest, an arme dexter holding an eagle's head and neck erased
gules.' And, for Bradshaw, he gives the coat, 'argent, 2 bendlets
sable,' noting 'his mother was a Bradshaw.'</p>

<p>On fol. 68<sup>v</sup>, in the pedigree, he gives the coats:&mdash;'Jeff&lt;rey&gt;, azure, a
fret or, on a chief or a lion passant gardant sable: impaling [Haughton],
sable, 3 bars argent': Bradshaw, as above; Powell of Foresthill and
Webber, left blank; and Minshull, '..., an estoyle over a crescent ...
a canton....'&gt;</p></div>

<p>His father was brought-up in the University of Oxon,
at Christ Church, and his grandfather disinherited him
because he kept not to the Catholique religion<a name="FNanchor_XVIII._45" id="FNanchor_XVIII._45"></a><a href="#Footnote_XVIII._45" class="fnanchor">[XVIII.]</a>.
So therupon he came to London, and became
a scrivener (brought up by a friend of his;
was not an apprentice), and gott a plentifull estate by it,
and left it off many yeares before he dyed.&mdash;He was an
ingeniose man; delighted in musique; composed
many songs now in print, especially

<h4>&lt;<i>His precocity.</i>&gt;</h4>

<p><a name="FNanchor_251_460" id="FNanchor_251_460"></a><a href="#Footnote_251_460" class="fnanchor">[251]</a>Anno Domini 1619, he was ten yeares old, as by his
picture; and was then a poet.</p>


<h4>&lt;<i>School, college, and travel.</i>&gt;</h4>

<p>His school-master then was a Puritan, in Essex, who
cutt his haire short.</p>

<p>He went to schoole to old Mr.<a name="FNanchor_252_461" id="FNanchor_252_461"></a><a href="#Footnote_252_461" class="fnanchor">[252]</a> Gill, at Paule's schoole.
Went, at his owne chardge<a name="FNanchor_253_462" id="FNanchor_253_462"></a><a href="#Footnote_253_462" class="fnanchor">[253]</a> only, to Christ's College in
Cambridge at<a name="FNanchor_254_463" id="FNanchor_254_463"></a><a href="#Footnote_254_463" class="fnanchor">[254]</a> fifteen, where he stayed eight yeares at
least<a name="FNanchor_255_464" id="FNanchor_255_464"></a><a href="#Footnote_255_464" class="fnanchor">[255]</a>. Then he travelled into France and Italie (&lt;he&gt;
had Sir H. Wotton's commendatory letters). At Geneva
he contracted a great friendship with<a name="FNanchor_256_465" id="FNanchor_256_465"></a><a href="#Footnote_256_465" class="fnanchor">[256]</a> the learned Dr.
Deodati of Geneva:&mdash;vide his poems. He was acquainted<a name="FNanchor_257_466" id="FNanchor_257_466"></a><a href="#Footnote_257_466" class="fnanchor">[257]</a>
with Sir Henry Wotton, ambassador at Venice, who delighted
in his company. He was severall<a name="FNanchor_XX._47" id="FNanchor_XX._47"></a><a href="#Footnote_XX._47" class="fnanchor">[XX.]</a> yeares
beyond sea, and returned<a name="FNanchor_258_467" id="FNanchor_258_467"></a><a href="#Footnote_258_467" class="fnanchor">[258]</a> to England just
upon the breaking-out of the civill warres.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="FNanchor_259_468" id="FNanchor_259_468"></a><a href="#Footnote_259_468" class="fnanchor">[259]</a>From his brother, Christopher Milton:&mdash;when he
went to schoole, when he was very young, he studied
very hard, and sate-up very late, commonly till 12 or
one a clock at night, and his father ordered the mayde
to sitt-up for him, and in those yeares (10) composed many
copies of verses which might well become a riper age.
And was a very hard student in the University, and performed
all his exercises there with very good applause.
His first tutor there was Mr. Chapell; from
whom receiving some unkindnesse<a name="FNanchor_XXI._48" id="FNanchor_XXI._48"></a><a href="#Footnote_XXI._48" class="fnanchor">[XXI.]</a>, he was
afterwards (though it seemed contrary to the rules of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>college) transferred to the tuition of one Mr. Tovell, who
dyed parson of Lutterworth.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="FNanchor_260_469" id="FNanchor_260_469"></a><a href="#Footnote_260_469" class="fnanchor">[260]</a>He went to travell about the year 1638 and was
abroad about a year's space, cheifly in Italy.</p>


<h4>&lt;<i>Return to England.</i>&gt;</h4>

<p>Immediately after his return he tooke a lodging at
Mr. Russell's, a taylour, in St. Bride's churchyard, and
took into his tuition his sister's two sons, Edward and
John Philips, the first 10, the other 9 years of age; and
in a year's time made them capable of interpreting a Latin
authour at sight, etc. And within three years they went
through the best of Latin and Greec poetts<a name="FNanchor_261_470" id="FNanchor_261_470"></a><a href="#Footnote_261_470" class="fnanchor">[261]</a>&mdash;Lucretius
and Manilius<a name="FNanchor_XXII._49" id="FNanchor_XXII._49"></a><a href="#Footnote_XXII._49" class="fnanchor">[XXII.]</a>, of the Latins; Hesiod, Aratus,
Dionysius Afer, Oppian, Apollonii <i>Argonautica</i>,
and Quintus Calaber. Cato, Varro, and Columella
<i>De re rustica</i> were the very first authors
they learn't.&mdash;As he was severe on one hand, so he was
most familiar and free in his conversation to those to whome
most sowre in his way of education. N.B. he made his
nephews songsters, and sing, from the time they were
with him.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_XXII._49" id="Footnote_XXII._49"></a><a href="#FNanchor_XXII._49"><span class="label">[XXII.]</span></a> and with him
the use of the
globes, and
some rudiments
of arithmetic
and geometry.</p></div>


<h4>&lt;<i>First wife and children.</i>&gt;</h4>

<p><a name="FNanchor_262_471" id="FNanchor_262_471"></a><a href="#Footnote_262_471" class="fnanchor">[262]</a>He maried his first wife<a name="FNanchor_XXIII._50" id="FNanchor_XXIII._50"></a><a href="#Footnote_XXIII._50" class="fnanchor">[XXIII.]</a> &lt;Mary&gt; Powell, of Fosthill,
at Shotover, in Oxonshire, anno Domini ...;
by whom he had 4 children. &lt;He&gt; hath two
daughters living: Deborah was his amanuensis
(he taught her Latin, and to read Greeke<a name="FNanchor_263_472" id="FNanchor_263_472"></a><a href="#Footnote_263_472" class="fnanchor">[263]</a>
to him when he had lost his eie-sight, which

<div class="footnote">

zealous royalist,
and went
without her
husband's
consent to her
mother in the
king's quarters.
She dyed anno

<h4>&lt;<i>Separation from his first wife.</i>&gt;</h4>

<p>[She<a name="FNanchor_264_473" id="FNanchor_264_473"></a><a href="#Footnote_264_473" class="fnanchor">[264]</a> went from him to her mother's at ... in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>king's quarters, neer Oxford], anno Domini ...; and
wrote the <i>Triplechord</i> about divorce.</p>

<p><a name="FNanchor_265_474" id="FNanchor_265_474"></a><a href="#Footnote_265_474" class="fnanchor">[265]</a>Two opinions<a name="FNanchor_266_475" id="FNanchor_266_475"></a><a href="#Footnote_266_475" class="fnanchor">[266]</a> doe not well on the same boulster.
She was a ...<a name="FNanchor_267_476" id="FNanchor_267_476"></a><a href="#Footnote_267_476" class="fnanchor">[267]</a> royalist, and went to her mother to the
king's quarters, neer Oxford. I have perhaps so much
charity to her that she might not wrong his bed: but
what man, especially contemplative, would like to have
a young wife environ'd and storm'd by the sons of Mars,
and those of the enemi partie?</p>

<p><a name="FNanchor_268_477" id="FNanchor_268_477"></a><a href="#Footnote_268_477" class="fnanchor">[268]</a>His first wife (Mrs. Powell, a royalist) was brought
up and lived where there was a great deale of company
and merriment<a name="FNanchor_269_478" id="FNanchor_269_478"></a><a href="#Footnote_269_478" class="fnanchor">[269]</a>. And when she came to live with her
husband, at Mr. Russell's, in St. Bride's churchyard, she
found it very solitary; no company came to her; oftentimes
heard his nephews beaten and cry. This life was
irkesome to her, and so she went to her parents at Fost-hill.
He sent for her, after some time; and I thinke his servant
was evilly entreated: but as for matter of wronging his
bed, I never heard the least suspicions; nor had he, of that,
any jealousie.</p>


<h4>&lt;<i>Second wife.</i>&gt;</h4>

<p><a name="FNanchor_270_479" id="FNanchor_270_479"></a><a href="#Footnote_270_479" class="fnanchor">[270]</a>He had a middle wife, whose name was (he<a name="FNanchor_271_480" id="FNanchor_271_480"></a><a href="#Footnote_271_480" class="fnanchor">[271]</a> thinkes,
Katharin) Woodcock. No child living by her.</p>


<h4>&lt;<i>Third wife.</i>&gt;</h4>

<p><a name="FNanchor_272_481" id="FNanchor_272_481"></a><a href="#Footnote_272_481" class="fnanchor">[272]</a>He maried his second<a name="FNanchor_273_482" id="FNanchor_273_482"></a><a href="#Footnote_273_482" class="fnanchor">[273]</a> wife, Elizabeth Minshull,
anno ... (the year before the sicknesse): a gent. person,
a peacefull and agreable humour.</p>


<h4>&lt;<i>His public employment.</i>&gt;</h4>

<p>He was Latin secretary to the Parliament<a name="FNanchor_274_483" id="FNanchor_274_483"></a><a href="#Footnote_274_483" class="fnanchor">[274]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span></p>

against Salmasius, and before 'twas fully compleated one

after that, his other eie decayed.</p>

<p><a name="FNanchor_276_485" id="FNanchor_276_485"></a><a href="#Footnote_276_485" class="fnanchor">[276]</a>His eie-sight was decaying about 20 yeares before

without spectacles at 84. His mother had very weake
eies, and used spectacles presently after she was thirty
yeares old.</p>


<h4>&lt;<i>Writings after his blindness.</i>&gt;</h4>

<p><a name="FNanchor_278_487" id="FNanchor_278_487"></a><a href="#Footnote_278_487" class="fnanchor">[278]</a>After he was blind he wrote these following bookes,

<p><a name="FNanchor_279_488" id="FNanchor_279_488"></a><a href="#Footnote_279_488" class="fnanchor">[279]</a>I heard that after he was blind that he was writing
a Latin Dictionary (in the hands of Moyses Pitt<a name="FNanchor_280_489" id="FNanchor_280_489"></a><a href="#Footnote_280_489" class="fnanchor">[280]</a>). Vidua
affirmat she gave all his papers (among which this dictionary,
imperfect) to his nephew, a sister's son, that he brought
up, ... Philips, who lives neer the Maypole in the Strand
(quaere). She has a great many letters by her from learned
men, his acquaintance, both of England and beyond sea.</p>


<h4>&lt;<i>His later residences.</i>&gt;</h4>

<p>He lived in several places, e.g. Holborne neer King's-gate.
He died in Bunhill, opposite to the Artillery-garden
wall.</p>


<h4>&lt;<i>His death and burial.</i>&gt;</h4>

<p>He died of the gowt<a name="FNanchor_281_490" id="FNanchor_281_490"></a><a href="#Footnote_281_490" class="fnanchor">[281]</a> struck in, the 9th or 10th of
November, 1674, as appeares by his apothecarye's booke.</p>

<p>He lies buried in St. Giles's Cripplegate, upper end of
chancell at the right hand, vide his gravestone<a name="FNanchor_282_491" id="FNanchor_282_491"></a><a href="#Footnote_282_491" class="fnanchor">[282]</a>.&mdash;Memo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>randum
his stone is now removed; for, about two yeares
since (now, 1681), the two steppes to the communion
table were raysed. I ghesse John Speed and he lie

<h4>&lt;<i>Personal characteristics.</i>&gt;</h4>

<p>His harmonicall and ingeniose soul did lodge<a name="FNanchor_283_492" id="FNanchor_283_492"></a><a href="#Footnote_283_492" class="fnanchor">[283]</a> in a

even in his gowte-fitts, and sing.</p>

<p>He was very healthy and free from all diseases: seldome
tooke any physique (only sometimes he tooke manna):
only towards his latter end he was visited with the gowte,
spring and fall.</p>

<p>He had a very good<a name="FNanchor_290_499" id="FNanchor_290_499"></a><a href="#Footnote_290_499" class="fnanchor">[290]</a> memorie; but I beleeve that his

helpe his memorie.</p>

<p>She has his picture when a Cambridge schollar, which
ought to be engraven; for the pictures before his bookes

<h4>&lt;<i>His habits.</i>&gt;</h4>

<p><a name="FNanchor_295_504" id="FNanchor_295_504"></a><a href="#Footnote_295_504" class="fnanchor">[295]</a>His exercise was chiefly walking.</p>

<p>He was an early riser (scil. at 4 a clock man&egrave;); yea, after
he lost his sight. He had a man read to him. The first
thing he read was the Hebrew Bible, and that was<a name="FNanchor_296_505" id="FNanchor_296_505"></a><a href="#Footnote_296_505" class="fnanchor">[296]</a> at
4 h. man&egrave; 1/2 h. +. Then he contemplated<a name="FNanchor_297_506" id="FNanchor_297_506"></a><a href="#Footnote_297_506" class="fnanchor">[297]</a>.</p>

<p>At 7 his man came to him again, and then read to him
again, and wrote till dinner: the writing was as much as
the reading. His (2) daughter, Deborah, could read to
him Latin, Italian and French, and Greeke. &lt;She&gt; maried
in Dublin to one Mr. Clarke (sells<a name="FNanchor_298_507" id="FNanchor_298_507"></a><a href="#Footnote_298_507" class="fnanchor">[298]</a> silke, etc.); very like
her father. The other sister is (1) Mary, more like her
mother.</p>

<p>After dinner he used to walke 3 or four houres at a time
(he alwayes had a garden where he lived); went to bed
about 9.</p>

<p>Temperate man, rarely dranke between meales.</p>

<p>Extreme pleasant in his conversation, and<a name="FNanchor_299_508" id="FNanchor_299_508"></a><a href="#Footnote_299_508" class="fnanchor">[299]</a> at dinner,
supper, etc.; but satyricall.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span><i>Paradise Lost</i>, his veine began at the autumnall aequinoctiall,
and ceased at the vernall (or thereabouts: I believe
about May): and this was 4 or 5 yeares of his doeing it.
He began about 2 yeares before the king came-in, and
finished about three yeares after the king's restauracion.</p>

<p>In the 4th<a name="FNanchor_302_511" id="FNanchor_302_511"></a><a href="#Footnote_302_511" class="fnanchor">[302]</a> booke of <i>Paradise Lost</i> there are about six
verses of Satan's exclamation to the sun, which Mr. E.
Philips remembers about 15 or 16 yeares before ever his
poem was thought of. Which verses were intended for
the beginning of a tragoedie which he had designed, but
was diverted from it by other businesse.</p>

no animosity to the king's person, or owt of any faction
or interest, but out of a pure zeale to the liberty of
mankind, which he thought would be greater under
a fre state than under a monarchiall goverment. His
being so conversant in Livy and the Roman authors,

and the vertue of their great commanders<a name="FNanchor_305_514" id="FNanchor_305_514"></a><a href="#Footnote_305_514" class="fnanchor">[305]</a> induc't

<p><a name="FNanchor_316_525" id="FNanchor_316_525"></a><a href="#Footnote_316_525" class="fnanchor">[316]</a>He was visited much by learned &lt;men&gt;; more then
he did desire.</p>

<p>He was mightily importuned to goe into France and
Italie. Foraigners came much to see him, and much
admired him, and offer'd to him great preferments to come
over to them: and the only inducement of severall
foreigners that came over into England, was chiefly to
see Oliver Protector, and Mr. John Milton; and would
see the house and chamber wher <i>he</i> was borne. He was
much more admired abrode then at home.</p>

<p>His familiar learned acquaintance were Mr. Andrew
Marvell, Mr. Skinner, Dr. Pagett, M.D.</p>

<p>Mr. &lt;Cyriack&gt; Skinner, who was his disciple.</p>

<p>John Dreyden, esq., Poet Laureate, who very much
admires him, and went to him to have leave to putt his
Paradise Lost into a drama in rhymne. Mr. Milton
recieved him civilly, and told him he would give him
leave to tagge his verses.</p>

<p>His widowe assures me that Mr. T. Hobbs was not one
of his acquaintance, that her husband did not like him at
all, but he would acknowledge<a name="FNanchor_317_526" id="FNanchor_317_526"></a><a href="#Footnote_317_526" class="fnanchor">[317]</a> him to be a man of
great parts, and a learned man. Their interests and
tenets did<a name="FNanchor_318_527" id="FNanchor_318_527"></a><a href="#Footnote_318_527" class="fnanchor">[318]</a> run counter to each other; vide in Hobbes'

<h3><b>George Monk</b> (1608-1670).</h3>


<p><a name="FNanchor_319_528" id="FNanchor_319_528"></a><a href="#Footnote_319_528" class="fnanchor">[319]</a>G. M<a name="FNanchor_320_529" id="FNanchor_320_529"></a><a href="#Footnote_320_529" class="fnanchor">[320]</a>. was borne at ... in Devon (vide Devon
in Heralds' Office), a second son of ..., an ancient
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>familie, and which had about Henry 8's time 10,000 <i>li.</i> per
annum (as he himselfe sayd).</p>

<p>He was a strong, lusty, well-sett young
fellow; and in his youth happened to slay
a man<a name="FNanchor_XXVI._53" id="FNanchor_XXVI._53"></a><a href="#Footnote_XXVI._53" class="fnanchor">[XXVI.]</a>, which was the occasion of his flying
into the Low-countries, where he learned to be a soldier.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_XXVI._53" id="Footnote_XXVI._53"></a><a href="#FNanchor_XXVI._53"><span class="label">[XXVI.]</span></a> From M<sup>ris</sup>
Linden, his
kinswoman, a
Devon woman
whose name was
Monke.</p></div>

<p>At the beginning of the late civill warres, he came over
to the king's side, where he had command (quaere in what
part of England).</p>

<p>Anno ... he was prisoner in the Tower, where his
semstres, Nan Cl&lt;arges&gt; (a blacksmith's<a name="FNanchor_XXVII._54" id="FNanchor_XXVII._54"></a><a href="#Footnote_XXVII._54" class="fnanchor">[XXVII.]</a>
daughter), was kind to him; in a double
capacity. It must be remembred that he then
was in want<a name="FNanchor_XXVIII._55" id="FNanchor_XXVIII._55"></a><a href="#Footnote_XXVIII._55" class="fnanchor">[XXVIII.]</a>, and she assisted him. Here she
was gott with child. She was not at all handsome,
nor cleanly. Her mother was one of the
five woemen barbers.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_XXVII._54" id="Footnote_XXVII._54"></a><a href="#FNanchor_XXVII._54"><span class="label">[XXVII.]</span></a> The shop is
still of that
trade; the
corner-shop, the
first turning on
the right hand
as you come out
of the Strand
into Drury-lane;
the howse is now
built of brick.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_XXVIII._55" id="Footnote_XXVIII._55"></a><a href="#FNanchor_XXVIII._55"><span class="label">[XXVIII.]</span></a> He was taken
prisoner by the
Parliament
forces, and kept
in the Tower;
and the trueth
was, he was
forgotten and
neglected at
Court, that they
did not thinke of
exchanging him,
and he was in
want.</p></div>

<p>Anno ... (as I remember, 1635) there was
a maried woman in Drury-lane that had clapt
(i.e. given the pox to) a woman's husband,
a neighbor of hers. She complained of this
to her neighbour gossips. So they concluded
on this revenge, viz. to gett her and whippe
her and ...; which severities were executed
and put into a ballad. 'Twas the first ballad I ever cared
for the reading of: the burden of it was thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Did yee ever heare the like<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Or ever heard the same<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of five woemen-barbers<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That lived in Drewry lane?<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Vide the Ballad-booke<a name="FNanchor_321_530" id="FNanchor_321_530"></a><a href="#Footnote_321_530" class="fnanchor">[321]</a>.</p>

<p>Anno ... her brother, T&lt;homas&gt; Cl&lt;arges&gt;, came a
ship-board to G. M. and told him his sister was brought to
bed. 'Of what?' sayd he. 'Of a son.' 'Why then,' sayd
he, 'she is my wife.' He had only this child.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span></p>
<p>Anno.., (I have forgott by what meanes) he gott his
libertie, and an employment under Oliver (I thinke) at sea,
against the Dutch, where he did good service; he had
courage enough. But I remember the sea-men would
laugh, that in stead of crying <i>Tack about</i>, he would say
<i>Wheele to the right</i> (or <i>left</i>).</p>

<p>Anno 16.. he had command in Scotland (vide his
life), where he was well beloved by his soldiers, and, I
thinke, that country (for an enemie). Oliver, Protector, had
a great mind to have him home, and sent him a fine complementall
letter, that he desired &lt;him&gt; to come
into England to advise with him. He sent
his highnesse word, that if he pleased he
would come and waite upon him at the
head of 10,000 men. So that designe was
spoyled.</p>

<p>Anno 1659/60, Febr. 10th (as I remember), being
then sent for by the Parliament to disband
Lambert's armie, he came into London with
his army about one a clock <span class="smcap">P.M.</span><a name="FNanchor_XXIX._56" id="FNanchor_XXIX._56"></a><a href="#Footnote_XXIX._56" class="fnanchor">[XXIX.]</a> He then
sent to the Parliament this letter, which<a name="FNanchor_322_531" id="FNanchor_322_531"></a><a href="#Footnote_322_531" class="fnanchor">[322]</a>,
printed, I annex here. Shortly after he was
sent for to the Parliament house; where, in the
howse, a chaire was sett for him, but he would
not (in modestie) sitt downe in it. The Parliament
(Rumpe<a name="FNanchor_XXX._57" id="FNanchor_XXX._57"></a><a href="#Footnote_XXX._57" class="fnanchor">[XXX.]</a>) made him odious to the citie,
purposely, by pulling down and burning their
gates (which I myselfe sawe). The Rumpe
invited him to a great dinner, Febr. ...
(shortly after); from whence it was never intended
that he should have returned (of this
I am assured by one of that Parliament).
The members stayd till 1, 2, 3, 4 a clock, but at last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
his excellency sent them word he could not come: I
beleeve he suspected some treacherie.</p>

<div class="footnote">

which I have seen. Both these were now in London
privately. Tom Mariett laye with me (I was then of the
Middle Temple); G. M. lay at Draper's hall<a name="FNanchor_323_532" id="FNanchor_323_532"></a><a href="#Footnote_323_532" class="fnanchor">[323]</a> in Throckmorton-street.
Col. Massey (Sir Edward afterwards), and
T. Mariett every day were tampering with G. M., as also
col. &lt;John&gt; Robinson (afterward Liewtenant of the Tower:
whom I remember they counted not so wise as King
Salomon); and they could not find any inclination or
propensity in G. M. for their purpose, scil. to be instrumentall
to bring in the king. Every night late, I had an
account of all these transactions abed, which like a sott
as I was, I did not, while fresh in memorie,
committ to writing, as neither has T. M.<a name="FNanchor_XXXI._58" id="FNanchor_XXXI._58"></a><a href="#Footnote_XXXI._58" class="fnanchor">[XXXI.]</a>:
but I remember in the maine, that they were satisfied he
no more intended or designed the king's restauration, when
he came into England, or first came to London, then his
horse did. But shortly after finding himselfe at a losse;
and that he was (purposely) made odious to the citie, as
aforesayd&mdash;and that he was a lost man&mdash;by the Parliament;
and that the generality of the citie and country were for the
restoring the king, having long groaned under the tyranny
of other governments; he had no way to save himselfe but
to close with the citie, etc., again. Memorandum that
Thredneedle-street was all day long, and late at night,
crammed with multitudes, crying out <i>A free Parliament,
a free Parliament</i>, that the aire rang with their clamours<a name="FNanchor_324_533" id="FNanchor_324_533"></a><a href="#Footnote_324_533" class="fnanchor">[324]</a>.
One evening, viz. Feb.... (quaere diem) he comeing out
on horseback<a name="FNanchor_325_534" id="FNanchor_325_534"></a><a href="#Footnote_325_534" class="fnanchor">[325]</a>, they were so violent that he was almost
afrayd of himselfe, and so, to satisfie them (as they use to
doe to importunate children), <i>Pray be quiet, yee shall have</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span><i>a free Parliament</i>. This about 7, or rather 8 as I remember
at night. Immediately a loud holla and shout was given,
all the bells in &lt;the&gt; city ringing, and the whole citie looked
as if it had been in a flame by the bonfires, which were
prodigiously great and frequent and ran like a traine over
the citie, and I sawe some balcone's that began to be
kindled. They made little gibbetts, and roasted<a name="FNanchor_326_535" id="FNanchor_326_535"></a><a href="#Footnote_326_535" class="fnanchor">[326]</a> rumpes
of mutton; nay, I sawe some very good rumpes of beefe<a name="FNanchor_327_536" id="FNanchor_327_536"></a><a href="#Footnote_327_536" class="fnanchor">[327]</a>.
Healths to the king, Charles II, were dranke in the streets
by the bonfires, even on their knees; and this humor ran
by the next night to Salisbury, where was the like joy; so
to Chalke, where they made a great bonfire on the top of
the hill; from hence to Blandford and Shaftesbury, and so
to the Land's-end: and perhaps it was so over all England.
So that the return of his most gracious majestie
was by the hand of <span class="smcap">God</span><a name="FNanchor_XXXII._59" id="FNanchor_XXXII._59"></a><a href="#Footnote_XXXII._59" class="fnanchor">[XXXII.]</a>; but as by this

History in 8vo. sayes (printed at ...

<p>Well! A free Parliament was chosen, and mett the ...
of.... Sir Harbottle Grimston, knight and baronet, was
chosen Speaker. The first thing he putt to the question
was, 'Whether <span class="smcap">Charles Steward</span> should be sent for, or
no?' 'Yea, yea,' <i>nemine contradicente</i>. Sir John Greenvill
(now earle of Bathe) was then in towne, and posted away
to Bruxells; found the king at dinner, little dreaming
of so good newes, rises presently from dinner, had his
coach immediately made readie, and that night
gott out of the king of Spaine's dominions
into the prince of Orange's country, I thinke,
Breda<a name="FNanchor_XXXIII._60" id="FNanchor_XXXIII._60"></a><a href="#Footnote_XXXIII._60" class="fnanchor">[XXXIII.]</a>.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_XXXIII._60" id="Footnote_XXXIII._60"></a><a href="#FNanchor_XXXIII._60"><span class="label">[XXXIII.]</span></a> This I have

his wife Bridget,
then at Bruxells,
say, severall
times.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span></p>

<p>Now, as the morne growes lighter and lighter, and more
glorious, till it is perfect day, so<a name="FNanchor_329_538" id="FNanchor_329_538"></a><a href="#Footnote_329_538" class="fnanchor">[329]</a>it was with the joy of the
people. Maypoles, which in the hypocriticall times, 'twas ...
to sett-up, now were sett up in every crosse-way:
and at the Strand, neer Drury-lane, was sett-up the most
prodigious one for height, that (perhaps) was ever seen;
they were faine (I remember) to have the assistance of the
sea-men's art to elevate it; that which remaines (being
broken with a high wind anno ..., I thinke about 1672) is
but two parts of three of the whole height from the grownd,
besides what is in the earth. The juvenile and rustique
folkes at that time had so much their fullnesse of desires
in this kind, that I thinke there have been very few sett-up
since. The honours conferred on G. M. every one knowes.</p>

<p>His sence might be good enough, but he was slow, and
heavie. He dyed anno ... and had a magnificent funerall,
suitable to his greatnesse. His figure in his robes was very
artificially donne, which lay in a catafalco under a canopie,
in or neer the east end of Westminster abby, a moneth
or 6 weekes. Seth Ward, lord bishop of Sarum (his great
acquaintance), preached his funerall sermon, which is
printed for.... His eldest brother dyed sine prole, about
the time of the King's returne. His other brother,
&lt;Nicholas Monk<a name="FNanchor_330_539" id="FNanchor_330_539"></a><a href="#Footnote_330_539" class="fnanchor">[330]</a>&gt; was made bishop of Hereford. G. M.
and his duchess dyed within a day or two of each other.
The bishop of Sarum told me that he did the last office of
a confessor to his grace; and closed his eies, as his lordship
told me himselfe.</p>

<p>Some moneths before G. M.'s comeing into England, the
king sent Sir Richard Grenvill (since earl of Bath) to him
to negotiate with him that he would doe him service, and
to correspond with him. Said he, 'If opportunity be, I will
doe him service; but I will not by any meanes have any
correspondence<a name="FNanchor_331_540" id="FNanchor_331_540"></a><a href="#Footnote_331_540" class="fnanchor">[331]</a> with him'; and he did like a wise man
in it; for if he had he would certainly have been betrayed.</p>

<p>'Twas shrewd advice which &lt;William&gt; Wyld, then
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>Recorder of London, gave to the citizens, i.e. to keep their
purse-strings fast; els, the Parliament would have payed
the army and kept out the king.</p>

<p>He was first an ensigne, and after a captain, in the Lowe-countreys,
and for making false musters was like to have

<h3><b>Sir Jonas Moore</b> (1617-1679).</h3>


<p><a name="FNanchor_333_542" id="FNanchor_333_542"></a><a href="#Footnote_333_542" class="fnanchor">[333]</a>Sir Jonas More: vide<a name="FNanchor_334_543" id="FNanchor_334_543"></a><a href="#Footnote_334_543" class="fnanchor">[334]</a> &#934;, p. <a href="#Page_128">128</a>. Sciatica he cured
it, by boyling his buttock. The D.<a name="FNanchor_335_544" id="FNanchor_335_544"></a><a href="#Footnote_335_544" class="fnanchor">[335]</a> Y. said that 'Mathematicians
and physicians had no religion': which being
told to Sir Jonas More, he presented his duty to the D. Y.<a name="FNanchor_336_545" id="FNanchor_336_545"></a><a href="#Footnote_336_545" class="fnanchor">[336]</a>
and wished 'with all his heart that his highnesse <i>were
a mathematician too</i>': this was since he was supposed to
be a Roman Catholic.</p>

<p><a name="FNanchor_337_546" id="FNanchor_337_546"></a><a href="#Footnote_337_546" class="fnanchor">[337]</a>He was a clarke under Dr. Burghill, Chancellor of
Durham. Parson Milbourne, in the Bishoprick, putt him
upon the Mathematiques, and instructed him in it. Then
he came to the Middle Temple, London, where he published
his Arithmetique, and taught it in Stanhop-street. After
this, gott-in with the lord Gorges, earle of Bedford, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>Sir Thomas Chichiley, for the surveying of the fennes:&mdash;from
captain Sherbourne.</p>

<p>Mr. ... Gascoigne (of the North, I thinke Yorkeshire),
a person of good estate, a most learned gentleman, who
was killed in the civill warres in the king's cause, a great
mathematician, and bred by the Jesuites at Rome, gave
him good information in mathematicall knowledge. Pray
inquire of our friend, Mr. Ralph Sheldon, for as many
memorialls of him<a name="FNanchor_AB_62" id="FNanchor_AB_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_AB_62" class="fnanchor">[AB]</a> as you can: he was one of the most
accomplisht gentlemen of his time.</p>

<p><a name="FNanchor_338_547" id="FNanchor_338_547"></a><a href="#Footnote_338_547" class="fnanchor">[338]</a>Sir Jonas Moore<a name="FNanchor_AC_63" id="FNanchor_AC_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_AC_63" class="fnanchor">[AC]</a> was borne at Whitelee in Lancashire,
towards the bishoprick of Durham. He was inclined
to mathematiques when a boy, which some kind friends<a name="FNanchor_339_548" id="FNanchor_339_548"></a><a href="#Footnote_339_548" class="fnanchor">[339]</a>
of his (whom he mentions in the preface of his first edition
of his Arithmetique, dedicated to ... about 1647, and
Edmund Wyld, esq.), and afterwards Mr. Oughtred, more
fully enformed him; and then he taught gentlemen in
London, which was his livelyhood.</p>

<p>When the great levell of the fennes was to be surveyed,
Mr. Wyld aforesaid who was his scholar and a member of
Parliament was very instrumentall in helping him to the
employment of surveying it, which was his rise, which I
have heard him acknowledge with much gratitude before
severall persons of quality, since he was a knight, and
which evidenced an excellent good nature in him.</p>

<p>&#9758; Memorandum:&mdash;when he surveyed the fennes, he
observed the line that the sea made on the beach, which is
not a streight line (quaere what line?), by which meanes he
gott great credit in keeping-out the sea in Norfolke; so<a name="FNanchor_340_549" id="FNanchor_340_549"></a><a href="#Footnote_340_549" class="fnanchor">[340]</a>
he made his bankes against the sea of the same line that
the sea makes on the beach; and no other could doe it,
but that the sea would still breake-in upon it.</p>

<p>Memorandum:&mdash;he made a modell of &lt;a&gt; citadell for
Oliver Cromwell, to bridle the city of London, which
Mr. Wyld has; and this citadell was to have been the
crosse building of St. Paule's church.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span></p>

<p>Upon the restauration of his majestie he was made
Master Surveyor of his majestie's ordinance and armories.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 167- he received the honour of knighthood. He
was a good mathematician, and a good fellowe.</p>

<p>He dyed at Godalmyng, comeing from Portsmouth to
London ..., and was buried Septemb. 2<sup>d</sup> 1679, at the
Tower Chapell, with sixtie peices of ordinance (equal to
the number of his yeares). He was tall and very fat, thin
skin, faire, cleare grey eie.</p>

<p>He alwayes intended to have left his library of mathematicall
bookes to the Royall Societie, of which he was
a member; but he happened to dye without making a will,
wherby the Royal Societie have a great losse.</p>

<p>His only sonne, Jonas, had the honour of knighthood
conferred upon him, August 9, 1680, at Windsor; 'his
majestie being pleased to give him this marke of his favour
as well in consideration of his owne abilities, as of the
faithfull service of his father deceased' (<i>London Gazette</i>, no.
1537)&mdash;but young Sir Jonas, when he is old, will never be
<i>old Sir Jonas</i>, for all the Gazette's elogie.</p>

<p>Memorandum:&mdash;speake to Sir Christopher Wren to gett
the wooden sphaere that was made for Prince Henry by
Mr. &lt;Edward&gt; Wright, out of young Sir Jonas Moore's
handes, into the king's again.</p>

<p>I remember Sir Jonas told us that a Jesuite (I think
'twas Grenbergerus, of the Roman College) found out
a way of flying, and that he made a youth<a name="FNanchor_341_550" id="FNanchor_341_550"></a><a href="#Footnote_341_550" class="fnanchor">[341]</a> performe it.
Mr. Gascoigne taught an Irish boy the way, and he flew
over a river in Lancashire (or therabout), but when he was
up in the ayre, the people gave a shoute, wherat the boy
being frighted, he fell downe on the other side of the river,
and broke his legges, and when he came to himselfe, he
sayd that he thought the people had seen some strange
apparition, which fancy amazed him. This was anno
1635, and he spake it in the Royall Societie, upon the
account of the flyeing at Paris, two yeares since. Vide
the Transactions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span></p>

<p>I remember I have heard Sir Jonas say that when he
began mathematiques, he wonderfully profited by reading
Billingesley's Euclid, and that 'twas his excellent, cleare,
and plaine exposition of the 4<sup>th</sup> proposition of the first
booke of the Elements, did first open and cleare his understanding:

<h3><b>Sir Robert Moray</b> (16&mdash;-1673).</h3>


<p><a name="FNanchor_342_551" id="FNanchor_342_551"></a><a href="#Footnote_342_551" class="fnanchor">[342]</a>Sir Robert Moray, knight:&mdash;he was of the ancient
family of the Morays in Scotland. He was borne ... (as
I take it, in the Highlands), anno domini.... The Highlanders
(like the Swedes) can make their owne cloathes;
and I have heard Sir Robert say that he could doe it.</p>

<p>He spent most of his time in France. After his juvenile
education at schoole and the University he betooke himselfe
to military employment in the service of Lewis the 13th.
He was at last Lieuetenant-Colonel to.... He was a great
master of the Latin tongue and was very well read. They
say he was an excellent soldier.</p>

<p>He was far from the rough humour of the camp breeding,
for he was a person the most obliging about the court and
the only man that would doe a kindnesse <i>gratis</i> upon an
account of friendship. A lacquey could not have been
more obsequious and diligent. What I doe now averre
I know to be true upon my owne score as well as others.
He was a most humble and good man, and as free from
covetousness as a Carthusian. He was abstemious and
abhorred woemen. His majesty was wont to teaze at him.
'Twas pitty he was a Presbyterian.</p>

<p>He was the chiefe appuy of his countreymen and their
good angel. There had been formerly a great friendship
between him and the duke of Lauderdale, till, about a yeare
or two before his death, he went to the duke on his returne<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
from Scotland and told him plainly that he had betrayed
his countrey.</p>

<p>He was one of the first contrivers and institutors of the
Royall Societie and was our first president, and performed
his charge in the chaire very well.</p>

<p>He was my most honoured and obligeing friend, and
I was more obliged to him then to all the courtiers besides.
I had a great losse in his death, for, had he lived, he would
have got some employment or other for me before this
time. He had the king's eare as much as any one, and
was indefatigable in his undertakings. I was often with him.
I was with him three houres the morning he dyed; he seemed
to be well enough<a name="FNanchor_343_552" id="FNanchor_343_552"></a><a href="#Footnote_343_552" class="fnanchor">[343]</a>. I remember he dranke at least 1/2 pint
of faire water, according to his usuall custome.</p>

<p>His lodgeing where he dyed was the leaded pavillion in
the garden at Whitehall. He dyed suddenly July 4<sup>th</sup>
about 8 hours <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> <span class="smcap">A&ordm;.D.</span> 1673. Had but one shilling in
his pocket, i.e. <i>in all</i>. The king buryed him. He lyes by
Sir William Davenant in Westminster abbey.</p>

<p>He was a good chymist and assisted his majestie in his
chymicall operations.</p>

<p><a name="FNanchor_344_553" id="FNanchor_344_553"></a><a href="#Footnote_344_553" class="fnanchor">[344]</a>Sir Thomas More<a name="FNanchor_AD_67" id="FNanchor_AD_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_AD_67" class="fnanchor">[AD]</a>, Lord Chancellour:&mdash;his countrey-howse
was at Chelsey, in Middlesex, where Sir John Danvers
built his house. The chimney-piece of marble in Sir John's
chamber, was the chimney-piece of Sir Thomas More's
chamber, as Sir John himselfe told me. Where the gate is
now, adorned with two noble pyramids, there stood anciently
a gate-house, which was flatt on the top, leaded, from
whence is a most pleasant prospect of the Thames and the
fields beyond. On this place the Lord Chancellour More
was wont to recreate himselfe and contemplate. It happened
one time that a Tom of Bedlam came-up to him, and had
a mind to have throwne him from the battlements, saying
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>'Leap, Tom, leap.' The Chancellour was in his gowne, and
besides ancient, and not able to struggle with such a strong
fellowe. My lord had a little dog with &lt;him&gt;; sayd he
'Let us first throwe the dog downe, and see what sport
that will be'; so the dog was throwne over. 'This is very
fine sport,' sayd my lord, 'let us fetch him up, and try once
more.' While the madman was goeing downe, my lord
fastned the dore, and called for help, but ever after kept
the dore shutt.</p>

then both together a bed in a truckle-bed in their father's

<p>His head was upon London bridge: there
goes this story in the family, viz. that one
day as one of his daughters was passing under
the bridge, looking on her father's head<a name="FNanchor_349_558" id="FNanchor_349_558"></a><a href="#Footnote_349_558" class="fnanchor">[349]</a>,
sayd she, 'That head haz layn<a name="FNanchor_350_559" id="FNanchor_350_559"></a><a href="#Footnote_350_559" class="fnanchor">[350]</a> many a time in my lapp,
would to God it would fall into my lap as I passe under.'
She had her wish, and it did fall into her lappe, and is now
preserved in a vault in the cathedrall church at Canterbury.
The descendant of Sir Thomas, is Mr. More, of Chilston,
in Herefordshire, where, among a great many things of
value plundered<a name="FNanchor_351_560" id="FNanchor_351_560"></a><a href="#Footnote_351_560" class="fnanchor">[351]</a> by the soldiers, was his chap, which they
kept for a relique. Methinks 'tis strange that all this time
he is not canonized, for he merited highly of the church.</p>

Bessils-Lye in Berks, is an original of Sir Thomas and his

<h3><b>Lancelot Morehouse</b> (16&mdash;-1672).</h3>


<p><a name="FNanchor_355_564" id="FNanchor_355_564"></a><a href="#Footnote_355_564" class="fnanchor">[355]</a>Mr. Launcelot Moorhouse, minister of Pertwood
(40 <i>li.</i> per annum), about 6 miles from Kilmanton, a very
learned man, and a solid and profound mathematician,
wrote against Mr. Francis Potter's booke of 666, and falls
upon him, for that 25 is not the true roote, but the propinque
root; to which Mr. Potter replied with some
sharpnes, and that it ought not to be the true roote, for
this agrees better with his purpose. The manuscript pro
and con Mr. Morehouse gave to Seth Ward, bishop of
Sarum, 1668; together with a MS. in folio (in French)
of legues between ... king of England and ... king of
France, and a prophecy concerning England, curiously
written in Latin verse, one sheet in 4to, which he rescued
from the tayler's sheeres.</p>

<p>Mr. Moorhouse (of Cambridge) is dead and left his
many excellent mathematicall notes to his ingeniose friend,
John Graunt, of Hindon.</p>

<p>He writt in 4to de Quadratura Circuli; wherin is a great
deale of witt and learning; but at last Dr. Davenant (his
neighbour) evinced him of his paralogisme. I would have
it printed (for it is learnedly<a name="FNanchor_356_565" id="FNanchor_356_565"></a><a href="#Footnote_356_565" class="fnanchor">[356]</a> donne) to show where and
how great witts may erre and be decieved.</p>

<p>He was a man of a very searching witt, and indefatigable
at solving a question, as I have heard Dr. Edward Davenant
oftentimes say.</p>

<p>He was either of Clare-hall or King's Colledge. Westmoreland
by birth. Curate at Chalke to Mr. Waller. He
was preferred by bishop &lt;Humphrey&gt; Hinchman to Little
Langford, where he dyed about 1672.</p>

'Sirrah, I'le cleave your skull!' as if the wordes had been
prolated by an eunuch.</p>

<p>He was of meane parentage in Monmouthshire. He went
over to the Lowe-Countrie warres about 16, being recommended
by some friend of his to some commander there, who,
when he read the letter, sayd, 'What! has my cosen ...
recommended a <i>rattoon</i> to me?' at which he tooke pett,

<p>These Morgans of Wells were 'cousins' of Aubrey: see in the life of Sir
Edmundbury Godfrey. The William Morgan who is there mentioned I take
to be William Morgan (son of John Morgan, gent., of Worminster, co. Som.)
who matriculated at Christ Church on Dec. 13, 1639, aged 17, to be the
Captain (or Major) William Morgan of this notice. William Morgan, the son,
of this notice, is probably William Morgan (son of William Morgan of Wells,

<h3><b>Sir William Neale</b> (1610-1690/1).</h3>


<p><a name="FNanchor_392_601" id="FNanchor_392_601"></a><a href="#Footnote_392_601" class="fnanchor">[392]</a>Sir William Neale, knight, skowt-master generall to
king Charles the first, died on the 24th of March last
1690/1, in Grayes Inne lane, being 81 yeares old. He was
buried, according to his desire, in Convent-garden church,
and lies at the west dore, first by the christning pew.
When he died, he was the oldest field-officer of king Charles
the first.</p>

<p>He was not lesse than 6 foot high: very beautifull in
youth&mdash;I remember him: and of great courage, but a
great plunderer and cruell.</p>

<p>He lived in towne ever since the Plott, and that worthy
generous gentleman Edmund Wyld, esq., was much
supporting to him. His mother and Sir William were
cosens german. But for these 5 yeares last past his
gowtes etc. emaciated him extremely; so that he did often
put me in mind of that of Ovid. Metamorph. &lt;<span class="smcap">XV.</span> 229&gt;,</p>

</div></div>

<p>He died poenitent.</p>

<p>He was the grandsonne of ... Neale, esq., of Wollaston
near Northampton, who maried one of Sir Edmund
Conquest's sisters, of Houghton-Conquest, Bedfordshire.
Sir Francis Clarke of Houghton-Conquest aforesaid (father
of Mr. Edmund Wyld's mother, a daughter and heir)
maried another sister of Sir Edmund Conquest.</p>

<p>Sir William maried major-generall Egerton's sister, by
whom he had issue William, a lusty stout fellow, of the
guards, who died about the abdication, and two daughters.</p>

<p>He lived at Fulham, and (perhaps) died there.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span></p>

<p>He made mappes of Middlesex, Hartfortshire, Surrey,

them, which Mr. Bagford hath, in quarto. The description
of Cornwall (I thinke) was not printed; but Dr. Gale of

<p>He printed a booke called a Preparative to Speculum

<p>Mr. Morgan, the herald painter, gives us an account
in his Armorie, that he had, in his custodie, Kent, Essex,

<p>In the end of Mr. Gregorie's posthumous workes, he

<h3><b>Roger North</b> (1585?-1652).</h3>


<p><a name="FNanchor_402_611" id="FNanchor_402_611"></a><a href="#Footnote_402_611" class="fnanchor">[402]</a>Captain Roger North was brother to &lt;Dudley, 3rd&gt;
lord North. He was a great acquaintance of Sir Walter
Ralegh's and accompanied him in his voyages. He was
with him at Guiana, and never heard that word<a name="FNanchor_403_612" id="FNanchor_403_612"></a><a href="#Footnote_403_612" class="fnanchor">[403]</a> but he
would fall into a passion for the miscariage of that action.</p>

<p>He was a great algebrist, which was rare in those dayes;
but he had the acquaintance of his fellow-traveller
Mr. Hariot.</p>

<p>He and his voyages are much cited in.... Voyages in
Latin in folio (quaere nomen libri a domino J. Vaughan<a name="FNanchor_404_613" id="FNanchor_404_613"></a><a href="#Footnote_404_613" class="fnanchor">[404]</a>).</p>

<p>He was a most accomplished gentleman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span></p>

<p>He died in Fleet Street about anno Domini 1656 or 57,
and buryed....</p>

<p>He had excellent collections and remarques of his
voyages, which were all unfortunately burnt in Fleet
Street at the great conflagration of the city.&mdash;From my
&lt;friend&gt; Sir Francis North, Lord Chiefe Justice of the
Common Pleas, his nephew, and Edmund Wyld, esq.,
who knew him very well.</p>

<p>He dyed about the time of the fire (?); quaere iterum.</p>

<p>This family speakes not well of Sir Walter Raleigh, that
Sir Walter designed to breake with the Spanyard, and to
make himselfe popular in England. When he came to ...,
he could not show them where the mines of gold
were. He would have then gonne to the king of France
(Lewis XIII), but his owne men brought him back.</p>

probleme in navigation experimentally verified, namely,
touching the compasse of the earth and sea, and the
quantity of a degree, in our English measure; also an exact
method or form of keeping a reckoning at sea in any kind
or manner of sayling, with certain tables and other rules
usefull in navigation; as also the plotting and surveying
of places, the latitude of the principal places in England,
the finding of the currents at sea and what allowance is to
be given in respect of them, by Richard Norwood, reader
of the Mathematicks, London, 1655, 4to&mdash;dedicated to

<p>He, at his owne chardge, measured with a chaine from
Barwick to Christ Church (he sayes he came up in ten or
eleven dayes) in order to the finding the quantitie of
a degree, and so the circumference of the earth and sea, in
our known measures&mdash;July 1, 1636.</p>

<p>Mr. attorney-generall Noy was a great lawyer and

of him.</p>

<p>He would play at spanne-counter with the taverne-barre-boy.</p>

<p>A countrey clowne asked for a good inne, and he bids
him ride into Lincoln's Inne, and asked if his horse went
to hay or to grasse.</p>

<p>He caused the breeches of a bencher of Lincolne's Inne
to be taken-in by a tayler and made him beleeve that he
had the dropsie.</p>

<p>One time he mett accidentally with Butler<a name="FNanchor_414_623" id="FNanchor_414_623"></a><a href="#Footnote_414_623" class="fnanchor">[414]</a>, the famous

walking in the gallerie. Noy was wearied, and would
be gonne. Butler would know his name. Noy had him to
the Peacock Taverne in Thames Street, and fudled all
that day.</p>

<p>Another time Noy and Pine of Lincolne's Inne went
afoot to Barnet with clubbes in their hands, like countrey<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>fellowes.

Thomas, earle of Strafford, Lord Liuetenant there, and
was there enterteined to teach in that family. And here
it was that first he gave proofs of his inclination to poetry,
by paraphrasing upon some of &AElig;sop's fables. (He writt
a fine hand.) He had<a name="FNanchor_434_643" id="FNanchor_434_643"></a><a href="#Footnote_434_643" class="fnanchor">[434]</a> a warrant from the Lord Livetenant

<p>Next, as if by a prophetique spirit, foreseeing the
restauration of King Charles II<sup>d</sup>, and also the want there
might be of Church Bibles, he<a name="FNanchor_445_654" id="FNanchor_445_654"></a><a href="#Footnote_445_654" class="fnanchor">[445]</a>printed the fairest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>impression, and the most correct of English Bibles, in royall
and imperiall paper, that ever was yet donne.</p>

<p>He printed and published his majestie's entertainment at
his coronation, in folio with cutts, 1662.</p>

<p>The same yeare (1662) he went into Ireland again, being
then, <i>by patent</i> (before, but by <i>warrant</i>) master of the
revells, having disputed his right with Sir William
Davenant, who had gott a graunt, and built a noble theatre
at Dublin, which cost 2000 <i>li.</i>, the former being ruined<a name="FNanchor_446_655" id="FNanchor_446_655"></a><a href="#Footnote_446_655" class="fnanchor">[446]</a> in
the troubles.</p>

<p>His Odysses came out in 1665. People did then suspect,
or would not beleeve that 'twas he was the author of the
paraphrase upon &AElig;sop, and to convince them he published
a 2<sup>d</sup> volume, which he calles his &AElig;sopiques, which<a name="FNanchor_447_656" id="FNanchor_447_656"></a><a href="#Footnote_447_656" class="fnanchor">[447]</a> he did

Odysses.</p>

then his History of Japan.</p>

<p>The generall and dreadfull conflagration burn't all that
he had, that he was faine to begin the world again, being
then at best worth 5 <i>li.</i></p>

<p>He had such an excellent inventive and prudentiall witt,
and master of so good addresse, that when he was undon
he could not only shift handsomely (which is a great
mastery<a name="FNanchor_448_657" id="FNanchor_448_657"></a><a href="#Footnote_448_657" class="fnanchor">[448]</a>), but he would make such rationall proposalls
that would be embraced by rich and great men, that in
a short time he could gaine a good estate again, and never
failed in any thing he ever undertooke but allwayes went
through with profits and honour<a name="FNanchor_449_658" id="FNanchor_449_658"></a><a href="#Footnote_449_658" class="fnanchor">[449]</a>.</p>

<p>Being thus utterly undon again by the fire, he made his

<p><a name="FNanchor_468_677" id="FNanchor_468_677"></a><a href="#Footnote_468_677" class="fnanchor">[468]</a>Mr. William Oughtred, B.D., Cambr., was borne at
Eaton, in Buckinghamshire, neer Windsor, Anno Domini
1574, March the fifth, 5 hours <span class="smcap">P.M.</span></p>

<p>His father taught to write at Eaton, and was a scrivener;
and understood common arithmetique, and 'twas no small
helpe and furtherance to his son to be instructed in it when
a schoole-boy. His grandfather came from the north for
killing a man. The last knight of the family was one
Sir Jeffrey Oughtred. I thinke a Northumberland family
(quaere).</p>

<p>Anno Domini ... he was chosen to be one of the
King's scholars at Eaton Colledge (vide register). <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> ...
he went to King's Colledge, in Cambridge.</p>

<p>Anno aetatis 23, he writt there his Horologiographia
Geometrica, as appeares by the title.</p>

<p>Anno Domini ... he was instituted and inducted into
the rectory or parsonage of Albury, in com. Surrey, lett
for<a name="FNanchor_469_678" id="FNanchor_469_678"></a><a href="#Footnote_469_678" class="fnanchor">[469]</a> a hundred pounds per annum: he was pastor of this
place fifty yeares.</p>

<p>He maried ... Caryl (an ancient family in those parts),
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>by whom he had nine sonnes (most lived to be men) and
four daughters. None of his sonnes he could make<a name="FNanchor_470_679" id="FNanchor_470_679"></a><a href="#Footnote_470_679" class="fnanchor">[470]</a>
scholars.</p>

<p>He was a little man, had black haire, and blacke eies
(with a great deal of spirit). His head<a name="FNanchor_471_680" id="FNanchor_471_680"></a><a href="#Footnote_471_680" class="fnanchor">[471]</a> was always
working. He would drawe lines and diagrams on the
dust.</p>

<p>His oldest son Benjamin, who lives in the house with
my cosen Boothby (who gives him his dyet) and now an
old man, he bound apprentice to a watchmaker; who did
worke pretty well, but his sight now failes for that fine
worke. He told me that his father did use to lye a bed
till eleaven or twelve a clock, with his doublet on, ever
since he can remember. Studyed late at night; went not
to bed till 11 a clock; had his tinder box by him; and on
the top of his bed-staffe, he had his inke-horne fix't. He
slept but little. Sometimes he went not to bed in two or
three nights, and would not come downe to meales till he
had found out the <i>quaesitum</i>.</p>

<p>He was more famous abroad for his learning, and more
esteemed, then at home. Severall great mathematicians
came over into England on purpose to converse<a name="FNanchor_472_681" id="FNanchor_472_681"></a><a href="#Footnote_472_681" class="fnanchor">[472]</a> with him.
His countrey neighbours (though they understood not his
worth) knew that there must be extraordinary worth in
him, that he was so visited by foreigners.</p>

<p>When Mr. Seth Ward, M.A. and Mr. Charles Scarborough,
D.M., came (as in pilgrimage, to see him and
admire him)&mdash;they lay at the inne at Sheeres (the next
parish)&mdash;Mr. Oughtred had against their comeing prepared
a good dinner, and also he had dressed himselfe, thus, an
old red<a name="FNanchor_473_682" id="FNanchor_473_682"></a><a href="#Footnote_473_682" class="fnanchor">[473]</a> russet cloath-cassock that had been black in dayes
of yore, girt with a old leather girdle, an old fashion russet
hatt, that had been a bever, tempore reginae Elizabethae.
When learned foreigners came and sawe how privately he
lived, they did admire and blesse themselves, that a person
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>of so much worth and learning should not be better
provided for.</p>

<p>Seth Ward, M.A., a fellow of Sydney Colledge in
Cambridge (now bishop of Sarum), came to him, and
lived with him halfe a yeare (and he would not take
a farthing for his diet), and learned all his mathematiques
of him. Sir Jonas More was with him a good while, and
learn't; he was but an ordinary logist before. Sir Charles
Scarborough was his scholar; so Dr. John Wallis was his
scholar; so was Christopher Wren his scholar; so was
Mr. ... Smethwyck, Regiae Societatis Socius. One Mr.
Austin (a most ingeniose man) was his scholar, and studyed
so much that he became mad, fell a laughing, and so dyed,
to the great griefe of the old gentleman. Mr. ... Stokes,
another scholar, fell mad<a name="FNanchor_474_683" id="FNanchor_474_683"></a><a href="#Footnote_474_683" class="fnanchor">[474]</a>, and dream't that the good old
gentleman came to him, and gave<a name="FNanchor_475_684" id="FNanchor_475_684"></a><a href="#Footnote_475_684" class="fnanchor">[475]</a>him good advice, and
so he recovered, and is still well. Mr. Thomas Henshawe,
Regiae Societatis Socius, was his scholar (then a young
gentleman). But he did not so much like any as those
that tugged &#9758; and tooke paines to worke out questions.
He taught all free.</p>

<p>He could not endure to see a scholar write an ill
hand; he taught them all presently to mend their hands.
Amongst others Mr. T. H.<a name="FNanchor_476_685" id="FNanchor_476_685"></a><a href="#Footnote_476_685" class="fnanchor">[476]</a> who when he came to him
wrote a lamentable hand, he taught to write very well.
He wrote a very elegant hand, and drew his schemes most
neatly, as they had been cut in copper. His father (no
doubt) was an ingeniose artist at the pen and taught him
to write so well.</p>

<p>He was an astrologer, and very lucky in giving his
judgements on nativities; he would say, that he did not
understand the reason why it should be so, but so it would
happen; he did beleeve that some genius or spirit did help.
&#9758; He has asserted the rational way of dividing the XII
houses according to the old way, which (the originall)
Elias Ashmole, esq., haz of his owne handwriting; which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>transcribe. Captaine George Wharton hath inserted it in
his Almanack, 1658 or 1659.</p>

<p>The countrey people did beleeve that he could conjure,
and 'tis like enough that he might be well enough contented
to have them thinke so. I have seen some notes of
his owne handwriting on Cattan's Geomantie.</p>

<p>He has told bishop Ward, and Mr. Elias Ashmole (who
was his neighbour), that 'on this spott of ground,' (or
'leaning against this oake,' or 'that ashe,') 'the solution of
such or such a probleme came into my head, as if infused
by a divine genius, after I had thought on it without
successe for a yeare, two, or three.'</p>

<p>Ben Oughtred told me that he had heard his father say
to Mr. Allen (the famous mathematicall instrument-maker),
in his shop, that he had found out the Longitude; <i>sed
vix credo</i>.</p>

<p>Nicolaus Mercator, Holsatus (whose mathematicall
writings ...), went to see him few yeares before he
dyed. 'Twas about midsommer, and the weather was very
hott, and the old gentleman had a good fire, and used
Mr. Mercator with much humanity (being exceedingly taken
with his excellent mathematicall witt), and one piece<a name="FNanchor_477_686" id="FNanchor_477_686"></a><a href="#Footnote_477_686" class="fnanchor">[477]</a> of
his courtesie was, to be mighty importunate with him to
sett on his upper hand next the fire; he being cold (with
age) thought he<a name="FNanchor_478_687" id="FNanchor_478_687"></a><a href="#Footnote_478_687" class="fnanchor">[478]</a> had been so too.</p>

<p>He<a name="FNanchor_479_688" id="FNanchor_479_688"></a><a href="#Footnote_479_688" class="fnanchor">[479]</a> was a great lover of chymistry, which he studyed
before his son Ben can remember, and continued it;
and told John Evelyn, of Detford, esq., R.S.S., not
above a yeare before he dyed, that if he were but
five yeares (or three yeares) younger, he doubted not
to find out the philosopher's stone. He used to talke
much of the mayden-earth<a name="FNanchor_XLIII._81" id="FNanchor_XLIII._81"></a><a href="#Footnote_XLIII._81" class="fnanchor">[XLIII.]</a> for the philosopher's
stone. It was made of the harshest
cleare water that he could gett, which he lett stand to
putrify, and evaporated by cimmering<a name="FNanchor_480_689" id="FNanchor_480_689"></a><a href="#Footnote_480_689" class="fnanchor">[480]</a>. Ben tended his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>furnaces. He has told me that his father would sometimes
say that he could make the stone. Quicksilver
refin'd and strain'd, and gold as it came naturall

<p>The old gentleman was a great lover of
heraldry, and was well knowne<a name="FNanchor_481_690" id="FNanchor_481_690"></a><a href="#Footnote_481_690" class="fnanchor">[481]</a> with the heralds

<p>Memorandum:&mdash;he struck-out above halfe

taught a gentleman in halfe a yeare to understand Latin,
at Mr. Duncombe's his parishioner. Quaere his daughter
Brookes at Oxford for it<a name="FNanchor_482_691" id="FNanchor_482_691"></a><a href="#Footnote_482_691" class="fnanchor">[482]</a>.</p>

<p><a name="FNanchor_483_692" id="FNanchor_483_692"></a><a href="#Footnote_483_692" class="fnanchor">[483]</a>His wife was a penurious woman, and would not
allow him to burne candle after supper, by which meanes
many a good notion is lost, and many a probleme
unsolved; so that Mr. &lt;Thomas&gt; Henshawe, when he was
there, bought candle, which was a great comfort to the
old man.</p>

<p>The right hon<sup>ble</sup> Thomas<a name="FNanchor_484_693" id="FNanchor_484_693"></a><a href="#Footnote_484_693" class="fnanchor">[484]</a> Howard, earle of Arundel and
Surrey, Lord High Marshall of England, was his great
patron<a name="FNanchor_485_694" id="FNanchor_485_694"></a><a href="#Footnote_485_694" class="fnanchor">[485]</a>, and loved him intirely. One time they were like
to have been killed together by the fall at Albury of a grott,
which fell downe but just as they were come out. &#9758; My
lord had many grotts about his house, cutt in the sandy
sides of hills, wherin he delighted to sitt and discourse.</p>

<p>In the time of the civill warres the duke of Florence
invited him over, and offered him 500 <i>li.</i> per annum; but
he would not accept of it, because of his religion.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding all that has been sayd of this excellent
man, he was in danger to have been sequestred, and ...
Onslowe that was a great stickler against the royalists and
a member of the House of Commons and living not far
from him&mdash;he translated his <i>Clavis</i> into English and
dedicated it to him to clawe with him, and it did soe his
businesse and saved him from sequestration. Now this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>Onslowe was no scholar and hated by the country<a name="FNanchor_486_695" id="FNanchor_486_695"></a><a href="#Footnote_486_695" class="fnanchor">[486]</a> for
bringing his countrymen of Surry into the trap of slaughter
when so many petitioners were killed at Westminster and
on the roads in pursuite, anno Domini 16&mdash;.</p>

<p>I have heard his neighbour ministers say that he was
a pittiful preacher; the reason was because he never
studyed it, but bent all his thoughts on the mathematiques;
but when he was in danger of being sequestred for a
royalist, he fell to the study of divinity, and preacht (they
sayd) admirably well, even in his old age.</p>

<p>He was a good Latinist and Graecian, as appears in
a little treatise of his against one Delamaine, a joyner,
who was so sawcy to write against him (I thinke about
his circles of proportion): upon which occasion I remember
I have seen, many yeares since, twenty or more good verses
made<a name="FNanchor_487_696" id="FNanchor_487_696"></a><a href="#Footnote_487_696" class="fnanchor">[487]</a>, which begin to this purpose:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">

<p>Enquire for them and insert them.</p>

<p>Before he dyed he burned a world of papers, and sayd
that the world was not worthy of them; he was so superb.
He burned also severall printed bookes, and would not
stirre, till they were consumed. His son Ben was confident
he understood magique. Mr. Oughtred, at the Custom
House, (his grandson) has some of his papers; I myselfe
have his Pitiscus, imbelished with his excellent marginall
notes, which I esteeme as a great rarity. I wish I could
also have got his Bilingsley's Euclid, which John Collins
sayes was full of his annotations.</p>

<p>He dyed the 13<sup>th</sup> day of June, 1660, in the yeare of his
age eighty-eight + odde dayes. Ralph Greatrex, his great
friend, the mathematicall instrument-maker, sayed he
conceived he dyed with joy for the comeing-in of the king,
which was the 29<sup>th</sup> of May before. 'And are yee sure he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>is restored?'&mdash;'Then give me a glasse of sack to<a name="FNanchor_489_698" id="FNanchor_489_698"></a><a href="#Footnote_489_698" class="fnanchor">[489]</a>drinke
his sacred majestie's health.' His spirits were then quite
upon the wing to fly away. The 15<sup>th</sup> of June he was
buried in the chancell at Albury, on the north side neer
the cancelli. I had much adoe to find the very place
where the bones of this learned and good man lay (and
'twas but 16 yeares after his death). When I first ask't
his son Ben, he told me that truly the griefe for his father's
death was so great, that he did not remember the place&mdash;now
I should have thought it would have made him
remember it the better&mdash;but when he had putt on his
considering cap (which was never like his father's), he told
as aforesaid, with which others did agree. There is not
to this day any manner of memorial for him there, which
is a great pitty. I have desired Mr. John Evelyn, etc.,
to speake to our patrone, the duke of Norfolk, to bestowe
a decent inscription of marble on him, which will also
perpetuate his grace's fame. I asked Ben concerning the
report<a name="FNanchor_490_699" id="FNanchor_490_699"></a><a href="#Footnote_490_699" class="fnanchor">[490]</a> of his father's dyeing a Roman Catholique: he told
me that 'twas indeed true that when he was sick some
priests came from my lord duke's (then Mr. Henry Howard,
of Norfolk) to him to have discoursed with him, in order
to his conversion to their church, but his father was then
past understanding. Ben was then by, he told me.</p>

<p>His <i>Clavis Mathematica</i> was first dedicated to the lord
&lt;Thomas<a name="FNanchor_491_700" id="FNanchor_491_700"></a><a href="#Footnote_491_700" class="fnanchor">[491]</a>&gt; Howard, earle of Arundel and Surrey, and
Lord Marshall of England, anno Domini <span class="smcap">MDCXXXI</span>,
London, apud Thomam Harperum.</p>

<p>His <i>Clavis Mathematica, denuo limata sive potius fabricata</i>
was printed by the said Thomas Harper, 1648.</p>

<p><i>Editio tertia auctior et emendatior</i> was at Oxford, 1652;
where Dr. John Wallis, the Savillian professor, corrected
the presse. The old gentleman in his Preface to the
Reader mentioned with much respect Seth Ward (Savillian
professor of Astronomy), Dr. Charles Scarborough, John
Wallis, Mr. Christopher Wren, and Mr. Robert Wood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span></p>

<p>He writt a stitch't pamphlet about 163(?4) against ...
Delamaine.</p>

<p>His first edition of his Circles of Proportion was in 4to,
and dedicated to Sir Kenelm Digby, printed.... The
second edition was at Oxford, 165-.</p>

<p>He writt a little pamphlett in 8vo, viz. <i>The new artificiall
gauging-rod, with the use therof</i>, London, printed
by Augustin Matthewes, 1633. Ben, &lt;his son&gt;, gave me
a copie of it; but this art is since much improved.</p>

<p>He wrote a little treatise of watchmaking for the use
of his son Benjamin, who told me that Mr. Horton of
Whitehall, of the Woodyard, haz the true copie of it.</p>

<p>Memorandum:&mdash;about 1678 were printed at Oxon at
the Theatre some opuscula of his....</p>

<p>I have heard Mr. Hobbes say, and very truely, that with
all his great skill in Algebra, he did never adde one proposition
to Geometrie: he could bind up a bundle well.</p>

<p>Mr. John Sloper, vicar of Broad Chalke (which is in
the gift of King's College, Cambridge) tells me that
Mr. Oughtred's father was the pantler of Eaton College.</p>

<p>I made bold lately when I sent my book in a leter
to Mr. Wood<a name="FNanchor_493_702" id="FNanchor_493_702"></a><a href="#Footnote_493_702" class="fnanchor">[493]</a> to nominate you and Mr. Wallis together
with him, to whose judgment and discretion I commit
all my right and interest for the printing therof at Oxford.
I nowe have sent the Epistle, which, though written long
since, yett was soe mislayed and mingled with many other
papers, that I thought it lost, and light but lately upon
it. Therin I make noe unloving mention of your self
and Dr. Scarbrough, whose surname I remember not.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span></p>

<p>I hope neyther of you will take my officiousnesse in evell
part. Yett yf anything shall displease, you are intreated
of me to alter it or raze it with a blott; but yf in and
by your suffrage it maye passe, I would intreat you to
supplie the Doctor's surname.</p>

<p>I have another suit, and that is in behalf of Mr. Brookes,
late chosen manciple of Wadham Colledg, that you would
be pleased to commend him and give him what countenance
you can with the Warden of the house. He is a very
honest man, well travelled and experienced in the world,
and is also an exact workman in his trade of making
mathematical instruments in metall.</p>

<p>Sir, you will be pleased to remember my best respects
to Mr. Wallis and favourably to pardon this troublesome

<h3><b>John Overall</b> (1560-1619).</h3>


<p><a name="FNanchor_495_704" id="FNanchor_495_704"></a><a href="#Footnote_495_704" class="fnanchor">[495]</a>Dr. Overall and his wife:&mdash;</p>

<p>Dr. &lt;John&gt; Overall was deane of St. Paules, London.</p>

<p>I see his picture in<a name="FNanchor_496_705" id="FNanchor_496_705"></a><a href="#Footnote_496_705" class="fnanchor">[496]</a> the rationale writt by &lt;Anthony&gt;
Sparrow, bishop of Exon, in the beginning wherof are the
effigies<a name="FNanchor_497_706" id="FNanchor_497_706"></a><a href="#Footnote_497_706" class="fnanchor">[497]</a> of L&lt;ancelot&gt; Andrews, bishop of Winton, Mr.
&lt;Richard&gt; Hooker, and John Overall, bishop of Norwich&mdash;before
which is writt <i>Ecclesiae et Liturgiae Anglicanae
vindices</i>. Quaere if this deane was that bishop.</p>

<p>I know not what he wrote or whether he was any more
than a common-prayer Doctor; but most remarqueable by
his wife, who was the greatest beautie in her time in
England. That she was so I have it attested from the
famous limmer<a name="FNanchor_498_707" id="FNanchor_498_707"></a><a href="#Footnote_498_707" class="fnanchor">[498]</a> Mr. &lt;John&gt; Hoskins<a name="FNanchor_499_708" id="FNanchor_499_708"></a><a href="#Footnote_499_708" class="fnanchor">[499]</a> and other old
painters, besides old courtiers. She was not more beautifull
than she was obligeing and kind, and was so tender-hearted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>that (truly) she could scarce denie any one. She had (they
told me) the loveliest eies that ever were seen, but wondrous
wanton. When she came to court or to the playhouse,
the gallants would so flock round her. Richard, the earle
of Dorset, and his brother Edward, since earle, both did
mightily adore her. And by their report he must have
had a hard heart that did not admire her. Bishop Hall
sayeth in his Meditations that 'there is none so old that
a beautifull person loves not; nor so young whom a lovely
feature moves not.'</p>

<p>The good old deane, notwithstanding he knew well
enough that he was horned, loved her infinitely: in so
much that he was willing she should enjoy what she had
a mind to.</p>

<p>Among others who were charmed by her was Sir John
Selby of Yorkshire. 1656, old Mris Tyndale (of the
Priory near Easton-piers), who knew her, remembres
a song made of her and Sir John, part whereof was this,
vizt.:&mdash;</p>

<h3><b>John Pell</b> (1610/1-1685).</h3>


<div class="blockquot">

<p>&lt;When Aubrey had finished the first sketch of this life he submitted
it for revision to Dr. Pell, who made several corrections. To these
Aubrey draws attention by a note:&mdash;'This is Dr. Pell's owne hand-writing:'
it is a neat print-like hand. These corrections in the text
here are enclosed in square brackets.&gt;</p></div>

the son of John.</p>

<p>John Pell, D.D., was the son of John Pell, ...<a name="FNanchor_517_726" id="FNanchor_517_726"></a><a href="#Footnote_517_726" class="fnanchor">[517]</a> of
Southwyck in Sussex, in which parish he was borne, at ...,
on St. David's day (1st of March) 1610<a name="FNanchor_518_727" id="FNanchor_518_727"></a><a href="#Footnote_518_727" class="fnanchor">[518]</a>, hor&acirc; ...
(his youngest uncle guessed about noon).</p>

<p>His father was [a divine] but a kind of Non-conformist;
of the Pells of Lincolnshire, an ancient familie; his mother
[of the Hollands of Kent]. His father dyed when his son
John was but 5 yeares old and six weekes, and left him an
excellent library.</p>

<p>&lt;He&gt; went to schoole at the free-schoole at Stenning,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>a burrough towne in Sussex, at the first founding of the
schoole; an excellent schoolmaster, John Jeffreys. At
13 yeares and a quarter old he went as good a scholar to
Cambridge, to Trinity Colledge, as most Masters of Arts
in the University (he understood Latin, Greek, and
Hebrew), so that he played not much (one<a name="FNanchor_519_728" id="FNanchor_519_728"></a><a href="#Footnote_519_728" class="fnanchor">[519]</a> must imagine)
with his schoolfellowes, for, when they had play-dayes,
or after schoole-time, he spent his time in the library
aforesaid.</p>

<p>He [never<a name="FNanchor_520_729" id="FNanchor_520_729"></a><a href="#Footnote_520_729" class="fnanchor">[520]</a> stood at any election of] fellow[s] or scholar[s
of the House at] Trinity College.</p>

<p>Of person he was very handsome, and of a very strong
and excellent habit of body, melancholic, sanguine, darke
browne haire with an excellent moist curle.</p>

<p>[Before<a name="FNanchor_521_730" id="FNanchor_521_730"></a><a href="#Footnote_521_730" class="fnanchor">[521]</a> he went first out of England,] he understood<a name="FNanchor_522_731" id="FNanchor_522_731"></a><a href="#Footnote_522_731" class="fnanchor">[522]</a>
these languages (besides his mother-tongue), viz. Latin,
Greek, Hebrue, Arabique, Italian, French, Spanish, High-Dutch,
and Low-Dutch.</p>

<p>Anno Domini 1632 he maried [Ithamara Reginalds,
second daughter to Mr. Henry Reginalds of London. He
had by her 4 sonnes and 4 daughters borne in this order<a name="FNanchor_523_732" id="FNanchor_523_732"></a><a href="#Footnote_523_732" class="fnanchor">[523]</a>
S., D., D., S., D., S., D., S.].</p>

<p>Dr. Pell haz sayd to me that he did believe that he
solved some questions <i>non sine divino auxilio</i>.</p>

<p>Anno Domini 1643 he went to Amsterdam, in December;
was there Professor of Mathematiques, next after Martinus
Hortensius, about 2 yeares.</p>

<p>1646, the prince of Orange called for him to be publique
professor of Philosophy and Mathematiques at the
<i>Schola Illustris</i> at Breda, that was founded that yeare
by his Highnesse; vide the Doctor's inaugurall oration<a name="FNanchor_524_733" id="FNanchor_524_733"></a><a href="#Footnote_524_733" class="fnanchor">[524]</a>
there, printed&mdash;the first thing printed that his name
was to.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span></p>

<p>He returned into England, 1652.</p>

<p>In 1654 Oliver, Lord Protector, sent him envoy&eacute; to the
Protestant cantons of Switzerland; resided chiefly at
Zurich. He was sent out with the title of <i>ablegatus</i>, but
afterwards he had order to continue there with the title of
<i>Resident</i>.</p>

<p>In 1658 he returned into England and so little before the
death of Oliver Cromwell that he never sawe him since he
was Protector.</p>

<p>Memorandum&mdash;when he tooke his leave from Zurich,
June 23, 1658, he made a Latin speech, which I have seen.</p>

<p>Memorandum that in his negociation he did no disservice
to King Charles II<sup>d</sup>, nor to the church, as may appeare by
his letters which are in the Secretarie's Office.</p>

Whistler, M.D., to live with him at the Physitians College
in London, where he was very kindly entertained. About
the middle of June he fell extreme sick of a cold and
removed to a grandchild of his maried to one Mr.
Hastings in St. Margaret's Churchyard, Westminster, neer

Drury Lane, where he was like to have been burnt in his

are of the value of two hundred pounds per annum (or

as to worldly affaires, and his tenants and relations cousin'd
him of the profits and kept him so indigent that he
wanted necessarys, even paper and inke, and he had not
6<i>d.</i> in his purse when he dyed, and was buried by the

at the house of Mr. Cothorne the reader in Dyot Street
on Saterday December the twelfth 1685, between 4 and 5
<span class="smcap">P.M.</span> Dr. Busby, schoolmaster of Westminster, bought all
his bookes and papers of Captain Raven, among which is
the last thing he wrote (which he did at my earnest
request) viz. <span class="smcap">THE TABLES</span>, which are according to his
promise in the last line of his printed tables of squares and
cubes (if desired) and which Sir Cyrillus Wych (then
president of the Royall Society) did license for the press.
There only wants a leafe or two for the explanation of
the use of them, which his death hath prevented. Sir
Cyril Wych, only, knowes the use of them. I doe
(imperfectly) remember something of his discourse of
them, viz. whereas some questions are capable of severall
answers, by the help of these tables it might be discovered
exactly how many, and no more, solutions, or answers,
might be given.</p>

<p>I desired Mr. Theodore Haake, his old acquaintance,
to make some additions to this<a name="FNanchor_561_770" id="FNanchor_561_770"></a><a href="#Footnote_561_770" class="fnanchor">[561]</a> short collection of

which the Dr. likt and accepted of, loving good cheer
and good liquour, which the other did also; where eating
and drinking too much, was the cause of shortning his
daies.</p>

<p>Dr. Pell had a brother a chirurgian and practitioner
in physick, who purchased an estate of the natives of
New-York and when he died he left it to his nephew
John Pell, only son of the Doctor. It is a great estate
8 miles broad and ... miles long (quaere Capt. ...
Raven).</p>

<p>He had 3 or 4 daughters.</p>

<h4><a name="FNanchor_565_774" id="FNanchor_565_774"></a><a href="#Footnote_565_774" class="fnanchor">[565]</a><i>This &lt;is&gt; writt by Mr. Theodore Haake.</i></h4>

<p>In the year 1638 I came first to be acquainted with
Mr. Pell by Mr. S. Hartlib's meanes, who having heard of
his extraordinarie parts in all kinde of learning, especially
the mathematics, perswaded that the same might be farre
more usefully employed and improoved for the publick
advancement of learning, he never left soliciting and engaging
frends heer to perswade Mr. Pell instead of keeping
scool, as he then did at ... in Sussex, to come up to
London, where he soon got into great esteem among the
most learned, both natives and forreigners, with whom he
conversed. But he so minded and followed still the
cultivating of his more abstracting studies, and naturally
averse from suing or stooping much for what he was
worthy of, it was a good while before he obtained any
suteable place or settlement.</p>

<p>I recommended him once to my Lord Bishop of Lincoln<a name="FNanchor_566_775" id="FNanchor_566_775"></a><a href="#Footnote_566_775" class="fnanchor">[566]</a>
(quondam Lord Keeper of England), who became very
desirous to see the man, inviting us of purpose to dine once
with his lordship for the freer discourse of all sorts of
literature and experiments, to get a touch and taste that
satisfaction Mr. Pell could give him. Which proved so
pertinent and abundant that my lord put the question to
him whether he would accept of a benefice which he was
ready, glad, and willing to bestow on him for his encouragement.
Mr. Pell thankd his lordship, saying he was
not capacitate for that, as being no divine and having
made the mathematics his main studie, for the great
publick need and usefullnesse therof, which he had in
a manner devoted himself to improve and advance to the
uttmost of his reach and abilities. Which answer pleased
my lord so well that he replyed, 'Alasse! what a sad
case it is that in this great and opulent kingdome there
is no publick encouragement for the excelling in any profession
but that of the law and divinity.<a name="FNanchor_567_776" id="FNanchor_567_776"></a><a href="#Footnote_567_776" class="fnanchor">[567]</a>Were I in place
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>as once I was, I would never give over praying and pressing
his majesty till a noble stock and fund might be raised for
so fundamentall, universally usefull, and eminent science
as mathematicks.' And therupon his lordship requested
Mr. Pell to befriend him with his visits as often as he could
spare time, promising him always a very hearty welcome.
Yet Mr. Pell who was no courtier came there no more.</p>

<p>In the mean time he communicated to his friends his
excellent <i>Idea Matheseos</i> in half a sheet of paper, which
got him a great deal of repute, both at home and abroad,
but no other special advantage, till Mr. John Morian,
a very learned and expert gentleman, gave me notice that
Hortensius, mathematical professor at Amsterdam, was
deceased, wishing that our friend Mr. Pell might succeed.
Sir William Boswell, his majestie's ambassador in Holland,
being here then, I conferred with him about it, who promised
all his assistance; and between them, and by these
two, a call was procured from Amsterdam for Mr. Pell,
in 1643: and in May 1644 I met him settled there on my
return out of Denmarke. Where he was, among others,
dearly welcome to Gerardus Joannes Vossius. And soon
after his fame was much augmented by his refuting a large
book of Longomontanus <i>Quadratura</i>, which caused the
Prince of Orange (Henry Frederick) being about to erect
an Academic at Breda, borrowed<a name="FNanchor_568_777" id="FNanchor_568_777"></a><a href="#Footnote_568_777" class="fnanchor">[568]</a> Mr. Pell from the
magistrate of Amsterdam, to grace his new Academy with
a man of that fame for a few years. And there being
comfortably stayed, the most learned of the then parliament
heer, jealous that others should enjoy a countryman of
their own, they never left offers and promises till they got
him hither to be&mdash;they gave out&mdash;Professor Honorarius
heer. But the sucesse prov'd soon deficient, and reduced
him to much inconvenience, as having now a charge of
a pretty large family, viz. his wife with 4 or 5 children.
And this continued till T. H.<a name="FNanchor_569_778" id="FNanchor_569_778"></a><a href="#Footnote_569_778" class="fnanchor">[569]</a> was offerd by Th.<a name="FNanchor_570_779" id="FNanchor_570_779"></a><a href="#Footnote_570_779" class="fnanchor">[570]</a> to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>employed in Swisse and about the E.<a name="FNanchor_571_780" id="FNanchor_571_780"></a><a href="#Footnote_571_780" class="fnanchor">[571]</a> collection for
Pyemont; who excused himself it and recommended
Mr. Pell.</p>

on St. David's day, anno Domini 1611; his youngest
uncle ghesses about noon.</p>

<p>Anno 1632 he maried.</p>

<p>1643, went to Amsterdam and was there professor of
Mathematiques.</p>

<p>1646, the Prince of Orange called for him to be publique
professor at Breda.</p>

<p>1654, Oliver, Protector, sent him envoy&eacute; to the cantons
of Switzerland.</p>

<p>1661, Gilbert Sheldon, bishop of London, gave him
a scurvy parsonage in Essex ('kill-priest').</p>

<p>1680, August last, he was arrested and layd in prison.</p>

October 1644. 'Twas upon a Monday he thinkes; but
'twas about 7 a clock in the morning.</p>

<p>(His father was a very good man, but no Quaker; was
very much against his sonne.)</p>

<p>Went to schoole in London, a private schole on that
hill, and his father kept a tutor in the house: but first he
went to school at Chigwell in Essex.</p>

<p>&lt;He was&gt; mighty lively, but with innocence; and<a name="FNanchor_580_789" id="FNanchor_580_789"></a><a href="#Footnote_580_789" class="fnanchor">[580]</a>
extremely tender under rebuke; and very early delighted
in retirement; much given to reading and meditating<a name="FNanchor_581_790" id="FNanchor_581_790"></a><a href="#Footnote_581_790" class="fnanchor">[581]</a>
of the scriptures, and at 14 had marked over the Bible.
Oftentimes at 13 and 14 in his meditations ravisht with
joy, and dissolved into teares.</p>

<p>The first sense he had of God was when he was
11 yeares old at Chigwell, being retired in a chamber alone.
He was so suddenly surprized with an inward comfort and
(as he thought) an externall glory in the roome that he
has many times sayd that from thence he had the seale of
divinity and immortality, that there was a God and that
the soule of man was capable of enjoying his divine communications.&mdash;His
schoolmaster was not of his perswasion.</p>

<p>To Christ's Church in Oxon anno 1660, anno aetatis 16;
stayed there about two yeares.</p>

<p>Anno 1662, went into France; stayd there two yeares.</p>

<p>Returnd and was entred of Lincoln's Inne.</p>

<p>About the plague, growing entirely solitary, was again
diverted. Was employed by his father in a journey into
Ireland to the duke of Ormond's court: the diversions of
which not being able to keepe downe the stronger motions
of his soule to a more religious and retired life, upon the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>hearing of one Th&lt;omas&gt; Lowe, a tradesman, of Oxon,
at Cork, 1667, was so thoroughly convinced of the simplicity
and selfe-deniall of the way of the people called Quakers
that from thence he heartily espoused that judgment<a name="FNanchor_582_791" id="FNanchor_582_791"></a><a href="#Footnote_582_791" class="fnanchor">[582]</a> and
beliefe.</p>

<p>Since which time he haz passed a life of great variety
of circumstances<a name="FNanchor_583_792" id="FNanchor_583_792"></a><a href="#Footnote_583_792" class="fnanchor">[583]</a>, both with respect to good and evill

She was a great fortune to her husband, being worth <i>de claro</i>
above 10,000 <i>li.</i> Her fortune, quality, and good humour
gave her the importunity of many suitors of extraordinary
condition, e.g. lord Brookes and lord J&lt;ohn&gt; &lt;Vaughan&gt;,
etc.; but valueing the unity of beliefe and the selfe deniall
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>of her profession above the glories of the world, resisted
their motions till Providence brought a man of equall
condicion and &#10683;<a name="FNanchor_603_812" id="FNanchor_603_812"></a><a href="#Footnote_603_812" class="fnanchor">[603]</a> to herself to the syncere embracing of
the same fayth, whose mariage haz been crowned with
a continued affection.</p>

<p>[Sir William Penn, knight<a name="FNanchor_604_813" id="FNanchor_604_813"></a><a href="#Footnote_604_813" class="fnanchor">[604]</a>,] his father, was a man of
excellent naturall abilities, not equalled in his time for the
knowledge of navall affayres and instrumentall to the
raysing of many families. Bred his son religiously; and, as
the times grew loose, would have had his sonne of the
fashion, and was therfore extreme bitter at his sonne's
retirement. But this lasted not alwayes; for, in the conclusion
of his life, he grew not only kind, but fonde; made
him the judge and ruler of his family; was sorry he had
no more to leave him (and yet, in England and Ireland,
he left him 1500 <i>li.</i> per annum). But, which is most
remarkeable, he that opposed his sonne's way because of
the crosse that was in it to the world's latitude, did himselfe
embrace this faith, recommending to his son the plainesse
and selfe deniall of it, sayeing 'Keep to the plainesse of
your way, and you will make an end of the priests to the
ends of the earth.' And so he deceased, desiring that
none but his son William should close his eies (which he
did). Obiit anno aetatis 49, 4 months.</p>

<p><a name="FNanchor_617_826" id="FNanchor_617_826"></a><a href="#Footnote_617_826" class="fnanchor">[617]</a>Sir William Petty, knight, was the [eldest<a name="FNanchor_618_827" id="FNanchor_618_827"></a><a href="#Footnote_618_827" class="fnanchor">[618]</a>, or only,] son
of ... Petty, of Rumsey in Hampshire, by ... his wife.</p>

<p>His father was borne on the Ashwednsday, before Mr.
Hobbes, scil. 1587; and dyed and was buryed at Rumsey
1644, where Sir William intends to sett up a monument
for him. He was by profession a clothier, and also did
dye his owne cloathes: he left little or no estate to Sir
William.</p>

<p>He<a name="FNanchor_619_828" id="FNanchor_619_828"></a><a href="#Footnote_619_828" class="fnanchor">[619]</a> was borne at his father's house aforesaid, which
is ..., on Monday, the twenty-sixth of May 1623, eleven
houres 42&acute; 56&#733; afternoone (vide Scheme<a name="FNanchor_620_829" id="FNanchor_620_829"></a><a href="#Footnote_620_829" class="fnanchor">[620]</a>): Xt<sup>ned</sup> on
Trinity Sunday.</p>

<p>Rumsey is a little haven towne, but hath most kinds
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>of artificers in it. When he was a boy his greatest delight
was to be looking on the artificers,&mdash;e.g. smyths, the watch-maker,
carpenters, joyners, etc.&mdash;and at twelve years old
could have worked at any of these trades. Here he went
to schoole, and learn't by 12 yeares a competent smattering
of Latin, and was entred into the Greek. He haz had
few sicknesses. About 8, in April very sick and so continued
till towards Michaelmas. &#9758; About 12 (or 13), i.e.
before 15, he haz told me, happened to him the most
remarkable <i>accident of life</i> (which he did not tell me), and
which was the foundation of all the rest of his greatnes
and acquiring riches.</p>

<p>He<a name="FNanchor_621_830" id="FNanchor_621_830"></a><a href="#Footnote_621_830" class="fnanchor">[621]</a> enformed me that, about 15, in March, he went over
into Normandy<a name="FNanchor_622_831" id="FNanchor_622_831"></a><a href="#Footnote_622_831" class="fnanchor">[622]</a>, to Caen, in a vessell that went hence, with
a little stock, and began to merchandize<a name="FNanchor_623_832" id="FNanchor_623_832"></a><a href="#Footnote_623_832" class="fnanchor">[623]</a>, and had so good
successe that he maintained himselfe, and also educated
himselfe; this I guesse<a name="FNanchor_624_833" id="FNanchor_624_833"></a><a href="#Footnote_624_833" class="fnanchor">[624]</a> was that most remarkable <i>accident</i>
that he meant. Here he learn't the French tongue, and
perfected himselfe in the Latin, and had Greeke enough
to serve his turne. Here (at Caen) he studyed the arts.
Memorandum:&mdash;he was sometime at La Flesshe in the
college of Jesuites. At 18, he was (I have heard him say)
a better mathematician then he is now: but when occasion
is, he knows how to recurre to more mathematical knowledge.
At Paris he studyed anatomie, and read Versalius
with Mr. Thomas Hobbes (vide Mr. Hobbs' life), who
loved his company. Mr. H. then wrot his Optiques; Sir
W. P. then had a fine hand in drawing and limning, and
drew Mr. Hobbes's opticall schemes for him, which he was
pleased to like. At Paris, one time, it happened that
he was driven to a great streight for money, and I have
heard him say, that he lived a weeke on two peniworth (or
3, I have forgott which, but I thinke the former) of walnutts.
Quaere whether he was not sometimes a prisoner there?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span></p>

<p>Anno Domini 164- he came to Oxon, and entred himselfe
of Brasen-nose college. Here he taught<a name="FNanchor_625_834" id="FNanchor_625_834"></a><a href="#Footnote_625_834" class="fnanchor">[625]</a> anatomy
to the young scholars. Anatomy was then but little
understood by the university, and I remember<a name="FNanchor_626_835" id="FNanchor_626_835"></a><a href="#Footnote_626_835" class="fnanchor">[626]</a> he kept

<p>Here he lived and was beloved by all the ingeniose

<p>Anno Domini ... (quaere) he was chosen musique

tooke his degree of Dr. of Physique anno Domini ... at ...

<p>He was about 1650 (quaere) elected Professor of
Musique at Gresham Colledge, by, and by the interest of,
his friend captaine John Graunt (who wrote the Observations
on the Bills of Mortality), and at that time was worth
but fourtie pounds in all the world.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span></p>

<p>Shortly after (scil. anno Domini 1652 in August, he had
the patent for Ireland) he was recommended
to the Parliament<a name="FNanchor_LIV._97" id="FNanchor_LIV._97"></a><a href="#Footnote_LIV._97" class="fnanchor">[LIV.]</a> to be one of the surveyors
of Ireland, to which employment capt. John

<p>To be short, he is a person of so great
worth and learning, and haz such a prodigious
working witt, that he is both fitt for, and an
honour to, the highest preferment.</p>

<p>By this surveying employment he gott an
estate in Ireland (before the restauration of King Charles II)
of 18000 <i>li.</i> per annum, the greatest part wherof he was
forced afterwards to refund<a name="FNanchor_634_843" id="FNanchor_634_843"></a><a href="#Footnote_634_843" class="fnanchor">[634]</a>, the former owners being then
declared innocents. He hath yet there 7 or 8000 <i>li.</i> per
annum and can, from the Mount Mangorton in the com.
of Kerry, behold 50000 acres of his owne land. He hath
an estate in every province of Ireland.</p>

<p>The kingdome of Ireland he hath surveyed, and that
with that exactnesse (quaere Sir J. H. de modo), that there
is no estate the&lt;re&gt; to the value of threscore pounds per
annum but he can shew, to the value, and those that he
employed for the geometricall part were ordinary fellowes,
some (perhaps) foot-soldiers, that circumambulated with
their <i>box and needles</i>, not knowing what they did, which
Sir William knew right well how to make use of.</p>

<p>Anno Domini 1667 (vide his Scheme<a name="FNanchor_635_844" id="FNanchor_635_844"></a><a href="#Footnote_635_844" class="fnanchor">[635]</a>), he maried on
Trinity Sunday ... the relict of Sir &lt;Maurice&gt; Fenton, of
Ireland, knight, daughter of Sir Hasdras Waller of Ireland
by ..., a very beautifull and ingeniose lady, browne, with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>glorious eies, by whom he hath ... sonnes, and ...
daughters, very lovely children, but all like the mother.
He has a naturall daughter that much resembles him,
no legitimate child so much, that acts at the Duke's play-house,
who hath had a child by ... about 1679. She is
(1680) about 21.</p>

<p><a name="FNanchor_636_845" id="FNanchor_636_845"></a><a href="#Footnote_636_845" class="fnanchor">[636]</a>I remember about 1660 there was a great difference
between him and Sir ... ..., one of Oliver's knights,
about.... They printed one against the other: this
knight was wont to preach at Dublin. The knight had
been a soldier, and challenged Sir William to fight with
him. Sir William is extremely short sighted, and being
the challengee it belonged to him to nominate<a name="FNanchor_637_846" id="FNanchor_637_846"></a><a href="#Footnote_637_846" class="fnanchor">[637]</a> place and
weapon. He nominates, for the place, a darke cellar, and
the weapon to be a great carpenter's axe. This turned
the knight's challenge into ridicule, and so it came to
nought.</p>

<p>He can be an excellent droll (if he haz a mind to
it) and will preach extempore incomparably, either the
Presbyterian way, Independent, Cappucin frier, or Jesuite.</p>

<p><a name="FNanchor_638_847" id="FNanchor_638_847"></a><a href="#Footnote_638_847" class="fnanchor">[638]</a>He recieved the honour of knighthood Anno Domini....</p>

<p>He had his patent for earle of Kilmore and baron of ...

envy<a name="FNanchor_LVI._99" id="FNanchor_LVI._99"></a><a href="#Footnote_LVI._99" class="fnanchor">[LVI.]</a>, but his sonne will have the benefitt

sonne would have broken-out a lord or earle:
&#9758; but it seemes that he had enemies at the court at
Dublin, which out of envy obstructed the passing of his
patent.]</p>

<p>Anno 1660 he came into England, and was presently
recieved into good grace with his majestie, who was
mightily pleased with his discourse.</p>

<p>Anno Domini 1663 he made his double-bottom'd vessell
(launched about new-yeere's tide), of which he gave a
modell to the Royall Societie made with his owne hands,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>and it is kept in the repository at Gresham College. It did
doe very good service, but anno 16&mdash;happned to be
lost in an extraordinary storme in the Irish sea. (Memorandum:&mdash;there
is yet a double bottomd vessell in the
Isle of Wight, made by one Mr. ... ... which, they say,
sailes well: quaere capt. Lee.)</p>

<p><a name="FNanchor_640_849" id="FNanchor_640_849"></a><a href="#Footnote_640_849" class="fnanchor">[640]</a>Anno Domini 1675/6 (vide the yeare of T. Deer's
lettres), March 18, he was correpted by the Lord Chancellor
Finch, when the patent for the farming of Ireland
was sealed, to which Sir William would not seale.
Monday, 20th March, he was affronted by Mr. Vernon:
Tuesday following Sir William and his ladie's brother (Mr.
Waller). Hectored Mr. Vernon and caned him.</p>

<p><a name="FNanchor_641_850" id="FNanchor_641_850"></a><a href="#Footnote_641_850" class="fnanchor">[641]</a>He went towards<a name="FNanchor_642_851" id="FNanchor_642_851"></a><a href="#Footnote_642_851" class="fnanchor">[642]</a> Ireland in order to be a member
of that Parliament, March 22, 1679/80&mdash;God send him a
prosperous journey.</p>

<p>1680<a name="FNanchor_643_852" id="FNanchor_643_852"></a><a href="#Footnote_643_852" class="fnanchor">[643]</a> ..., he went to Rumsey to see his native country,
and to erect a monument to his father.</p>

<p>He is a person of an admirable inventive head, and
practicall parts. He hath told me that he hath read but
little, that is to say, not since 25 aetat., and is of Mr.
Hobbes his mind, that had he read much, as some men have,
he had not known so much as he does, nor should have
made such discoveries and improvements.</p>

<p>I remember one St. Andrewe's day (which is the day
of the generall meeting of the Royall Society for annuall
elections), I sayd, 'methought 'twas not so well that we
should pitch upon the Patron of Scotland's day, we should
rather have taken St. George or St. Isidore' (a philosopher
canonized). 'No,' said Sir William,' I would rather have
had it<a name="FNanchor_644_853" id="FNanchor_644_853"></a><a href="#Footnote_644_853" class="fnanchor">[644]</a> on St. Thomas day, for he would not beleeve till
he had seen<a name="FNanchor_645_854" id="FNanchor_645_854"></a><a href="#Footnote_645_854" class="fnanchor">[645]</a> and putt his fingers into the holes,' according
to the motto <i>Nullius in verba</i>.</p>

<p>He haz told me that he never gott by legacies in his
life, but only x <i>li.</i> which was not payd.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span></p>

<p><a name="FNanchor_646_855" id="FNanchor_646_855"></a><a href="#Footnote_646_855" class="fnanchor">[646]</a>He has told me, that wheras some men have
accidentally come into the way of preferment, by lying at
an inne, and there contracting an acquaintance;
on the roade; or as some others<a name="FNanchor_LVII._100" id="FNanchor_LVII._100"></a><a href="#Footnote_LVII._100" class="fnanchor">[LVII.]</a> have
donne; he never had any such like opportunity,

the lord

was on ship-board.</p></div>

<p>He is a proper handsome man, measured six
foot high, good head of browne haire, moderately
turning up: vide his picture as Dr. of
Physique. His eies are a kind of goose-grey,
but very short sighted, and, as to aspect,
beautifull, and promise sweetnes of nature, and they doe
not decieve, for he is a marveillous good-natured person,
and &#949;&#8020;&#963;&#960;&#955;&#945;&#947;&#967;&#957;&#959;&#962;. Eie-browes thick, darke, and straight
(horizontall). His head is very lardge, &#956;&#945;&#954;&#961;&#959;&#954;&#8051;&#966;&#945;&#955;&#959;&#962;. He
was in his youth very slender, but since these twenty
yeares and more past he grew very plump, so that now
(1680) he is <i>abdomine tardus</i>. This last March, 1679/80,
I perswaded him to sitt for his picture to Mr. Loggan,
the graver, whom I forthwith went for myselfe, and he
drewe it just before his goeing into Ireland, and 'tis very like
him. But about 1659, he had a picture in miniture drawne
by his friend and mine, Mr. Samuel Cowper (prince of
limners of his age), one of the likest that ever he drew.</p>

<p><a name="FNanchor_654_863" id="FNanchor_654_863"></a><a href="#Footnote_654_863" class="fnanchor">[654]</a>I have heard Sir William say more than once, that

master<a name="FNanchor_LVIII._101" id="FNanchor_LVIII._101"></a><a href="#Footnote_LVIII._101" class="fnanchor">[LVIII.]</a> (a master of a shippe) bade him
climbe-up the rope ladder, and give notice when
he espied such a steeple (somewhere upon the coast of
England or France, I have forgot where), which was
a land-marke for the avoyding of a shelfe; at last the
master sawe it on the deck, and they fathom'd and found
they were but ... foot water, wherupon (as I remember)
his master drubb't him with a cord.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_LVIII._101" id="Footnote_LVIII._101"></a><a href="#FNanchor_LVIII._101"><span class="label">[LVIII.]</span></a> He was first
bound apprentice
to a
sea-captaine.</p></div>

<p>Before he went into Ireland, he sollicited, and no doubt
he was an admirable good sollicitor. I have heard him
say that in solliciting (with the same paines) he could
dispatch severall businesses, nay, better than one alone,
for by conversing with severall he should gaine the more
knowledge, and the greater interest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span></p>

<p>In the time of the warre with the Dutch, they concluded
at the councell-board at London, to have so many
sea men out of Irland (I thinke 1500). Away to Irland
came one with a commission, and acquaints Sir William
with it; sayes Sir William, 'you will never rayse this
number here.' 'Oh,' sayd the other, 'I warrant you, I
will not abate you a man.' Now Sir William knew 'twas
impossible, for he knew how many tunne of shipping
belongd to Ireland, and the rule is, to ... tunnes
so many men. Of these shipps halfe were abroad, and
of those at home so many men unfit. In fine, the commissioner
with all his diligence could not possibly rayse
above 200 seamen there. So we may see how statesmen
may mistake for want of this Politique Arithmetique.</p>

<p>Another time the councell at Dublin were all in a great
racket for the prohibition of coale from England and
Wales, considering that all about Dublin is such a vast
quantity of turfe; so they would improve their rents, sett
poor men on worke, and the city should be served with
fuell cheaper. Sir William <i>prima facie</i> knew that this
project could not succeed. Sayd he, 'If you will make
an order to hinder the bringing-in of coales by foreigne
vessells, and bring it in vessells of your owne, I approve
of it very well: but for your supposition of the cheapnesse
of the turfe, 'tis true 'tis cheape on the place, but consider
carriage, consider the yards that must contayn such a
quantity for respective houses, these yards must be rented;
what will be the chardge?' The&lt;y&gt; supputated, and
found that (every thing considered) 'twas much dearer then
to fetch coale from Wales, or etc.</p>

<p>Memorandum:&mdash;about 1665 he presented to the Royall
Societie a discourse of his (in manuscript, of about a quire
of paper) of building of shippes, which the lord Brounker
(then president) tooke away, and still keepes, saying, ''Twas
too great an arcanum of state to be commonly perused';
but Sir William told me that Dr. Robert Wood, M.D.,
aforesayd, has a copie of it, which he himselfe haz not:
quaere Dr. Wood for it.</p>

Prestbury in Gloucestershire, anno Domini 1601, in
September, on Michelmas-Eve. His mother's name was
Bagehott (an heire to a younger brother); his father was
Andrew Philips, of an ancient familie in Herefordshire,
seaven descents, who sold 600 <i>li.</i> per annum in Herefordshire,
in Leominster; some of it his sonne Fabian (of whom
I write) bought again. He was of the Middle Temple,
London; a filizer of London, Middlesex, Cambridgeshire,
and Huntingdonshire. Of great assiduity, and reading,
and a great lover of antiquities. He haz a great memorie,
which holds still well now in his 80th yeare. He told me
St. Austin wrote at 90; judge Coke at 84; and bishop
Hall, of Norwych, at 8-. His house is over against the
middle of Lincoln's Inne garden, in Chancery Lane. Two
dayes before king Charles 1st was beheaded, he wrote
a 'protestation against the intended murther of the king,'
and printed it, and caused it to be putt upon the posts.
When all the courts in Westminster-hall were voted-downe
by Barebones Parliament, he wrote a booke to justifie the
right use of them, and Lenthall (the speaker) and the
Keepers of the Libertie did send him thanks for saveing
of the courts.</p>

<h3><b>Sir John Popham</b> (1531-1607).</h3>


<p><a name="FNanchor_703_912" id="FNanchor_703_912"></a><a href="#Footnote_703_912" class="fnanchor">[703]</a>Sir John Popham<a name="FNanchor_AV_108" id="FNanchor_AV_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_AV_108" class="fnanchor">[AV]</a>, Lord Chiefe Justice of the King's
Bench, was the ... son of ... Popham, of ... in
the countie of Somerset.</p>

<p>He was of the Societie of ... and for severall &lt;years&gt;
addicted himselfe but little to the studie of the lawes, but
profligate company, and was wont to tak a purse with them.
His wife considered her and his condition, and at last
prevailed with him to lead another life, and to stick to the
studie of the lawe: which, upon her importunity, he did,
being then about thirtie yeares old. &lt;He&gt; spake to his
wife to provide a very good entertainment for his camerades
to take his leave of them; and after that day fell extremely
hard to his studie, and profited exceedingly. He was
a strong, stout man, and could endure to sit
at it day and night<a name="FNanchor_LIX._106" id="FNanchor_LIX._106"></a><a href="#Footnote_LIX._106" class="fnanchor">[LIX.]</a>; became eminent in his
calling, had good practise; called to be a

<p>Sir ... (John, I think) Dayrell, of Littlecote, in com.
Wilts, having gott his ladie's waiting woman with child,
when her travell came, sent a servant with a horse for
a midwife, whom he was to bring hood-winked. She was
brought, and layd the woman, but as soon as the child was
borne, she sawe the knight take the child and murther it,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>and burnt it in the fire in the chamber. She having donne
her businesse was extraordinarily rewarded for her paines,
and sent blinfold away. This horrid action did much run
in her mind, and she had a desire to discover it, but knew not
where 'twas. She considerd with herselfe the time that she
was riding, and how many miles might be rode at that rate
in that time, and that it must be some great person's house,
for the roome was 12 foot high; and she could know the
chamber if she sawe it. She went to a Justice of Peace,
and search was made. The very chamber found. The
knight was brought to his tryall; and to be short, this
judge had this noble howse, parke, and mannor,
and (I thinke) more, for a bribe to save
his life<a name="FNanchor_LX._107" id="FNanchor_LX._107"></a><a href="#Footnote_LX._107" class="fnanchor">[LX.]</a>.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_LX._107" id="Footnote_LX._107"></a><a href="#FNanchor_LX._107"><span class="label">[LX.]</span></a> Sir John
Popham gave

<i>noli prosequi</i>.</p></div>

<p>I have seen his picture; he was a huge,
heavie, ugly man. He left a vast estate to his
son, Sir Francis (I thinke ten thousand pounds, per annum);
he lived<a name="FNanchor_705_914" id="FNanchor_705_914"></a><a href="#Footnote_705_914" class="fnanchor">[705]</a> like a hog, but his sonne John was a great
waster, and dyed in his father's time.</p>

<p>He<a name="FNanchor_706_915" id="FNanchor_706_915"></a><a href="#Footnote_706_915" class="fnanchor">[706]</a> was the greatest howse-keeper in England; would
have at Littlecote 4 or 5 or more lords at a time. His
wife (Harvey) was worth to him, I thinke, 60000 <i>li.</i>, and
she was as vaine as he, and she sayd that she had brought
such an estate, and she scorned but she would live as high
as he did; and in her husband's absence would have all
the woemen of the countrey thither, and feast them, and
make them drunke, as she would be herselfe. They both
dyed by excesse; and by luxury and cosonage by their
servants, when he dyed, there was, I thinke, a hundred
thousand pound debt.</p>

<p>Old Sir Francis, he lived like a hog, at Hownstret in
Somerset, all this while with a moderate pittance.</p>

<p>Mr. John would say that his wive's estate was ill gott,
and that was the reason they prospered no better; she would
say that the old judge gott the estate unjustly, and thus they
would twitt one another, and that with matter of trueth.</p>

<p><a name="FNanchor_715_924" id="FNanchor_715_924"></a><a href="#Footnote_715_924" class="fnanchor">[715]</a>Mr. Francis Potter, B.D., was borne at the
[vicaridge<a name="FNanchor_716_925" id="FNanchor_716_925"></a><a href="#Footnote_716_925" class="fnanchor">[716]</a>] house at Mere in the county of Wiltes,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>anno Domini [1594, upon Trinity Sunday eve, in the
evening].</p>

<p>His father was minister there, and also of Kilmanton
in com. Somerset about 3 miles distant, and was also
a prebendary of the Cathedrall Church of Worcester.
He had three sonnes, Hannibal, Francis, and....
His wife's name was Horsey, of the worshipfull and
ancient family of the Horseys of Clifton in com. Dorset.</p>

<p>He was taught his grammar learnings by Mr. &lt;Henry&gt;
Bright (the famous school master of those times) of the
schoole at Worcester.</p>

<p>Anno &aelig;tatis &lt;15&gt; (vide A. Wood's <i>Antiq. Oxon.</i>) he
went to Trinity Colledge in Oxon, where his father (who
was an Oxfordshire man borne) had been a fellowe. His
brother Hannibal was his tutor. Here he was a commoner
twenty-seaven yeares, and was senior to all the house but
Dr. Kettle and his brother.</p>

<p>His genius lay most of all to the mechanicks; he had
an admirable mechanicall invention, but in that darke time
wanted encouragement, and when his father dyed (which
was about 1637) he succeeded him in the parsonage of
Kilmanton, worth, per annum, about 140<i>li.</i> He was from
a boy given to draweing and painting. The founder's
(Sir Thomas Pope's) picture in Trinity Colledge hall is of
his copying. He had excellent notions for the raysing of
water; I have heard him say, that he could rayse the
water at Worcester with lesse trouble, i.e. fewer ...,
then there are; and that he had never seen a water-house
engine, but that he could invent<a name="FNanchor_717_926" id="FNanchor_717_926"></a><a href="#Footnote_717_926" class="fnanchor">[717]</a> a better. Kilmanton is
on a high hill, and the parsonage-well is extraordinary
deepe. There is the most ingeniose and usefull buckett-well,
that ever I sawe. Now, whereas some deepe wells have
wheeles for men or doggs to go within them, here is
a wheele of ... foot diameter, with steps (like stayres)
to walke on as if you were goeing up staires, and an
ordinary bodye's<a name="FNanchor_718_927" id="FNanchor_718_927"></a><a href="#Footnote_718_927" class="fnanchor">[718]</a> weight drawes-up a great bucket, which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>holdes a barrell, and the two bucketts are contrived so
that their ropes alwaies are perpendicular and consequently
parallell, and so never interfere with one another. Now,
this vast buckett would be to combersome to overturne
to power out the water; and therefore, he contrived a board
with lifts about the sides, like a trough, to slide under the
bucket, when 'tis drawne up; and at the bottom of the
buckett is a plug, the weight of the water jogging upon
the sliding trough, the water powres out into the trough,
and from thence runnes into your paile, or other vessell.
'Tis extremely well worth the seeing. I have<a name="FNanchor_719_928" id="FNanchor_719_928"></a><a href="#Footnote_719_928" class="fnanchor">[719]</a> taken heretofore
a draught of it. I have heard him say that he would
have undertaken to have brought up the water from the
springs at the bottom of the hill to the towne of Shaftesbury,
which is on a waterles hill.</p>

<p>Anno Domini 16&lt;25&gt; (see<a name="FNanchor_720_929" id="FNanchor_720_929"></a><a href="#Footnote_720_929" class="fnanchor">[720]</a> part ii) goeing into his
chamber, the notion of 25, the roote of 666, for the roote
of the number of the Beast in the Revelation, came into his
head; so he opposed 25 to 12, the roote of 144.</p>

<p>When he tooke his degree of Batchelaur in Divinity,
his question was, An Papa sit Anti-Christus? Aff.&mdash;In
his younger yeares he was very apt to fall into a swoune,
and so he did when he was disputing in the Divinity-schoole
upon that question.&mdash;I remember he told me that
one time reading Aristotle de Natura Animalium, where
he describes how that the lionesses, when great with
young, and neer their time of parturition, doe goe between
two trees that growe neer together, and squeeze out
their young ones out of their bellies; he had such
a strong idea of this, and of the paine that the lionesse was
in, that he fell into a swoune.</p>

<p>He was of a very tender constitution, and sickly most
of his younger yeares. His manner was, when he was
beginning to be sick, to <i>breath strongly</i> a good while
together, which he sayed did emitt the noxious vapours.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span></p>

<p>He was alwayes much contemplative, and had an
excellent philosophicall head. He was no great read man;
he had a competent knowledge in the Latin, Greeke, and
Hebrue tongues, but not a critique. Greeke he learn'd by ...
Montanus's Interlineary Testament<a name="FNanchor_721_930" id="FNanchor_721_930"></a><a href="#Footnote_721_930" class="fnanchor">[721]</a>, after he was
a man, without a grammar, and then he read Homer. He
understood only common Arithmetique, and never went
farther in Geometrie then the first six bookes of Euclid;
but he had such an inventive head, that with this foundation
he was able to doe great matters in the mechaniques, and
to solve phaenomena in naturall philosophy. He had but
few bookes, which when he dyed were sold for fifty-six
shillings, and surely no great bargaine. He published<a name="FNanchor_722_931" id="FNanchor_722_931"></a><a href="#Footnote_722_931" class="fnanchor">[722]</a>
nothing but his <i>Interpretation of the number 666</i>, in 4to,
printed at Oxford, 1642, which haz been twice translated
into Latin, into French, and other languages<a name="FNanchor_AX_112" id="FNanchor_AX_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_AX_112" class="fnanchor">[AX]</a>. He made
the fine diall with its furniture, on the north wall of the
quadrangle at Trinity Colledge, which he did by Samminitiatus's
booke of Dialling (it haz been gonne about 1670, and
another is there putt). He lived and dyed<a name="FNanchor_723_932" id="FNanchor_723_932"></a><a href="#Footnote_723_932" class="fnanchor">[723]</a> a batchelour.
He was hospitable, vertuous, and temperate; and, as
I sayd before, very contemplative. He lookt the most
like a monk, or one of the pastours of the old time, that
I ever sawe one. He was pretty long visagd and pale
cleare skin, gray eie. His discourse was admirable, and
all new and unvulgar. His house was as undeckt<a name="FNanchor_724_933" id="FNanchor_724_933"></a><a href="#Footnote_724_933" class="fnanchor">[724]</a> as
a monke's cell; yet he had there so many ingeniose
inventions that it was very delightfull. He had a pretty
contrived garden there, where are the finest box hedges
of his planting that ever I sawe.
The garden is a good large square;
in the middle is a good high
mount, all fortified (as you may
say) and adorned with these
hedges, which at the interstices
of ... foot have a high pillar (square cutt) of box,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>that shewes very stately and lovely both summer and
winter.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 700px;">
<img src="images/i_p164.png" width="700" height="444" alt="" />
</div>

<p>On the buttery-dore in his parlour he drew his father's
picture at length, with his booke (fore-shortned), and on
the spectacles in his hand is the reflection of the Gothique
south windowe. I mention this picture the rather, because
in processe of time it may be mistaken by tradition for his
son Francis's picture, author of the booke aforesayd.</p>

<p>I never have enjoyed so much pleasure, nor ever so
much pleased with such philosophicall and heartie entertainment
as from him. His booke was in the presse at
Oxford, and he there, when I was admitted of the College,
but I had not the honour and happinesse to be acquainted
with him till 1649 (Epiphanie), since which time I had
a conjunct friendship with him to his death, and corresponded
frequently with him. I have all his letters by me,
which are very good, and I beleeve neer 200, and most
of them philosophicall.</p>

<p>I have many excellent good notes from him as to
mechaniques, etc., and I never was with him but I learn't,
and alwayes tooke notes; but now indeed the Royall
Societie haz out-donne most of his things, as having a
better apparatus, and more spare money. I have a curious
designe of his to drawe a landskip or perspective (1656),
but Sir Christopher Wren hath fallen on the same principle,
and the engine is better work't. He was smyth and
joyner enough to serve his turne, but he did not pretend
to curiosity in each. He gave me a quadrant in copper,
and made me another in silver, of his owne projection,
which serves for all latitudes. He shewed me, 1649, the
best way of making an arch was a parabola with a chaine;
so he tooke of his girdle from his cassock, and applyed it
to the wall, thus:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">
<img src="images/i_p165.png" width="700" height="193" alt="" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span></p>

<p>He invented and made with his owne handes a paire
of beame<a name="FNanchor_725_934" id="FNanchor_725_934"></a><a href="#Footnote_725_934" class="fnanchor">[725]</a> compasses, which will divide an inch into
a hundred or a thousand parts. At one end of the beame<a href="#Footnote_725_934" class="fnanchor">[725]</a>
is a roundle, which is divided into 100 equall parts, with
a sagitta to turne about it with a handle: this handle
turnes a skrew of a very fine thread, and on the back of the
saile or beame is a graduation. With these compasses he
made the quadrants aforesayd. He gave me a paire of
these compasses, which I shewed to the<a name="FNanchor_726_935" id="FNanchor_726_935"></a><a href="#Footnote_726_935" class="fnanchor">[726]</a> Royall Societie
at their first institution, which they well liked, and
I presented them as a rarity to my honoured friend, Edmund
Wyld, esqre. There are but<a name="FNanchor_727_936" id="FNanchor_727_936"></a><a href="#Footnote_727_936" class="fnanchor">[727]</a> two of them in the world.</p>

<p>&#9758; Memorandum that at the Epiphanie, 1649, when
I was at his house, he then told me his notion of curing
diseases, etc. by transfusion of bloud<a name="FNanchor_LXI._110" id="FNanchor_LXI._110"></a><a href="#Footnote_LXI._110" class="fnanchor">[LXI.]</a> out of
one man into another, and that the hint came
into his head reflecting on Ovid's story of Medea
and Jason, and that this was a matter of ten
yeares before that time. About a yeare after,
he and I went to trye the experiment, but
'twas on a hen, and the creature to little and
our tooles not good: I then sent him a surgeon's lancet.
Anno ... I recieved a letter from him concerning this
subject, which many yeares since I shewed, and was read
and entred in the bookes of the Royall Societie, for
Dr. Lower would have arrogated the invention to himselfe,
and now one [R.<a name="FNanchor_728_937" id="FNanchor_728_937"></a><a href="#Footnote_728_937" class="fnanchor">[728]</a> Griffith,] Dr. of Physique, of

and pipe in my letter unto you but
that I feare it might be an occasion
that my letter might not come into
your hands.&mdash;This is the rude figure
of it which I do here set down
because I thinke it the most convenient
for this purpose:&mdash;</p>

<div class="hangindent">

<p>'<i>a</i> = the necke of the craw which goeth to the mouth.</p>

<p>'<i>b</i> = the other necke which goeth from the craw to the
gissar. Another pipe may be tied to this end
and put into the veine of another living creature
at the same time.</p>

<p>'<i>d</i> = a little crooked ivory pipe, fastened (as a clister pipe
is) to a bladder.</p>

<p>'<i>e</i> = the capacity of the craw or bladder.'</p></div>

<p>
'Sir,<br />
</p>

<p>'I received that oyle in a little glasse which you had
from Mr. Decreet and a receipt in another letter, and
I desire you not to impute it to my unthankefulnes that
I did not thanke you for it in my last letter. I have most
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>times such sorrow and discontents in my breast which
make me forget my selfe and my best friends and such
things as I most delight in.</p>

<p>'If I should have occasion to write anything unto you in
characters you may be pleased to remember this key, that
the three first letters and every other three letters doe
<i>quiescere</i> and that a comma is placed at the end of every
word. As for example this writing:&mdash;</p>

<p>
'Sed c&aelig;ssat ar, otracci elusus, subest:&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">'that is,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">'c&aelig;sar occisus est,</span><br />
</p>

<p>'You need but cancell or make a line under every other
three letters, and then you may easily and speedily read
it, as this example:&mdash;</p>

<p>'<i>Sed</i> c&aelig;s<i>sat</i> ar, o<i>tra</i>cci <i>elu</i>sus, <i>sub</i>est.</p>

<p>'<del>Sed</del> c&aelig;s<del>sat</del> ar, o<del>tra</del>cci <del>elu</del>sus, <del>sub</del>est.</p>

<p>
'Sir,<br />

<p>'I humbly present my service and best wishes unto
you and shall still be</p>

Royall Societie, and was there admitted and recieved with
much respect.</p>

<p>As he was never a strong man, so in his later times he
had his health best, only about four or five yeares before
his death his eie-sight was bad, and before he dyed quite
lost. He dyed ... and is buryed in ... of the

<p>Memorandum: he played at chesse as well as most men.
Col. Bishop, his contemporary at Trinity Coll., is accounted
the best of England. I have heard Mr. Potter say that
they two have played at Trin. Coll. (I thinke 2 daies
together) and neither gott the maistery. Memorandum:
he would say that he look't upon the play at chesse &lt;as&gt;
very fitt to be learn't and practised by young men, because
it would make them to have a foresight and be of use to
them (by consequence) in their ordering of humane affaires.
Quod N.B.</p>

<p>He haz told me that he had oftentimes dream't that he
was at Rome, and being in fright that he should be seised

<p>'Twas pitty that such a delicate inventive
witt should be staked to a private preferment
in an obscure corner (where he wanted ingeniose
conversation), from whence men rarely emerge
to higher preferment, but contract a mosse
on them like an old pale in an orchard for
want of ingeniose conversation, which is a great want even
to the deepest thinking men (as Mr. Hobbes haz often sayd
to me).</p>

<p>The last time I sawe this honoured friend of mine,
Octob. 1674. I had not seen him in 3 yeares before, and
his lippitude then was come even to blindnesse, which did
much grieve me to behold. He had let his beard be
uncutt, which was wont to be but little. I asked him why
he did not get some kinswoman<a name="FNanchor_732_941" id="FNanchor_732_941"></a><a href="#Footnote_732_941" class="fnanchor">[732]</a> or kinsman of his to live<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
with him, and looke to him now in his great age? He
answer'd me that he had tryed that way, and found it not
so well; for they did begrudge what he spent that 'twas
too much and went from them, whereas his servants
(strangers) were kind to him and tooke care of him.</p>

<p>In the troublesome times 'twas his happinesse never to
bee sequestred. He was once maliciously informed against
to the Committee at Wells (a thing very common in those
times). When he came before them, one of them (I have
forgot his name) gave him a pint of wine, and gave him
great prayse, and bade him goe home, and feare nothing.</p>

bought this estate, June, 1684, haz all the old evidences,
and can farther enforme me.</p>

<p>But this family and Clifford are the very same, as may
be seen by the pedegre of Clifford, who was <i>de Pons</i> till

<p>This family have had a great estate, and were men of
note at Court.</p>

Gresill, one of the daughters and co-heires of ... Gibbons,

Smyth, who had been his lady's chamber-mayd, whose
name was John, as I remember, who maried ... daughter
of ... Cesar, in com. Hertf. He dyed without issue about
4 or 5 years since (1684), or lesse. So there is an end of
this ancient family.</p>

a roll and a pott of ale<a name="FNanchor_LXIV._114" id="FNanchor_LXIV._114"></a><a href="#Footnote_LXIV._114" class="fnanchor">[LXIV.]</a> to refocillate his

him till night; and then he made a good

<a name="FNanchor_LXVIII._121" id="FNanchor_LXVIII._121"></a><a href="#Footnote_LXVIII._121" class="fnanchor">[LXVIII.]</a>he would be perpetually differing with ... (I

hearing was to be at &lt;the&gt; councell table before the
queen, which was that he desired; where he told his tale
so well and with so good a grace and presence that the

<p><a name="FNanchor_780_989" id="FNanchor_780_989"></a><a href="#Footnote_780_989" class="fnanchor">[780]</a>Queen Elizabeth loved to have all the servants of
her Court proper men, and (as beforesaid Sir W. R.'s
gracefull presence was no meane recommendation to him).
I thinke his first preferment at Court was Captaine of her
Majestie's guard. There came a countrey gentleman (or
sufficient yeoman) up to towne, who had severall sonns,
but one an extraordinary proper handsome fellowe, whom
he did hope to have preferred to be a yeoman of the
guard. The father (a goodly man himselfe) comes to Sir
Walter Raleigh a stranger to him, and told him that he
had brought up a boy that he would desire (having many
children) should be one of her majestie's<a name="FNanchor_781_990" id="FNanchor_781_990"></a><a href="#Footnote_781_990" class="fnanchor">[781]</a>guard.
Quod Sir Walter Raleigh 'Had you spake for your selfe
I should readily have graunted your desire, for your person
deserves it, but I putt in no boyes.' Said the father, 'Boy,
come in.' The son<a name="FNanchor_782_991" id="FNanchor_782_991"></a><a href="#Footnote_782_991" class="fnanchor">[782]</a> enters, about 18 or 19, but such
a goodly proper young fellow, as Sir Walter Raleigh had
not seen the like&mdash;he was the tallest of all the guard. Sir
Walter Raleigh sweares him immediately; and ordered
him to carry-up the first dish at dinner, where
the Queen beheld him with admiration<a name="FNanchor_LXIX._122" id="FNanchor_LXIX._122"></a><a href="#Footnote_LXIX._122" class="fnanchor">[LXIX.]</a>, as
if a beautifull young giant had stalked in

and into fashion.&mdash;In our part of North Wilts, e.g.
Malmesbury hundred, it came first into fashion by Sir
Walter Long.</p>

<p>I have heard my grandfather Lyte say that one pipe
was handed from man to man round about the table.
They had first silver pipes; the ordinary sort made use
of a walnutshell and a straw.</p>

<p>It was sold then for it's wayte in silver.
I have heard some<a name="FNanchor_LXX._123" id="FNanchor_LXX._123"></a><a href="#Footnote_LXX._123" class="fnanchor">[LXX.]</a> of our old yeomen neighbours
say that when they went to Malmesbury or Chippenham

in the scales against the tobacco.</p>

some MSS. reciepts, I have seen some secrets from him.
He studyed most in his sea-voyages, where he carried
always a trunke of bookes along with him, and had nothing
to divert him.</p>

could spare in the morning. He was no slug; without
doubt, had a wonderfull waking spirit, and great judgment
to guide it.</p>


<h4>&lt;<i>His residences.</i>&gt;</h4>

<p>Durham-house was a noble palace; after he came to his
greatnes he lived there, or in some apartment of it. I well
remember his study, which was a little turret that looked
into and over the Thames, and had the prospect which is
pleasant perhaps as any in the world, and which not only
refreshes the eie-sight but cheeres the spirits, and (to speake
my mind) I beleeve enlarges an ingeniose man's thoughts.</p>

<p>Shirburne castle, parke, mannor, etc., did belong (and
still ought to belong) to the church of Sarum. 'Twas
aliened in ... time (quaere bishop of Sarum) to ...;
then ...; then Sir W. R. begged &lt;it&gt; as a b&ocirc;n from
queen Elizabeth: where he built a delicate lodge in the
park, of brick, not big, but very convenient for the bignes,
a place to retire from the Court in summer time, and to
contemplate, etc. Upon his attainder, 'twas begged by the
favorite Carr, earl of Somerset, who forfeited it (I thinke)
about the poysoning of Sir Thomas Overbury. Then
John, earl of Bristowe, had it given him for his good
service in the ambassade in Spaine, and added two wings
to Sir Walter Ralegh's lodge. In short and indeed 'tis
a most sweet and pleasant place and site as any in the
West, perhaps none like it.</p>


<h4>&lt;<i>His acquaintance.</i>&gt;</h4>

<p>In his youth his companions were boysterous blades, but
generally those that had witt; except otherwise uppon
designe to gett them engaged for him,&mdash;e.g. Sir Charles
Snell, of Kington Saint Michael in North Wilts, my good
neighbour, an honest young gentleman but kept a perpetuall
sott, he engaged him to build a ship (the Angel Gabriel)
for the designe for Guiana, which cost him the mannor of
Yatton-Keynell, the farme at Easton-Piers, Thornhill, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
the church-lease of Bishops Cannings; which ship, upon
Sir Walter Raleigh's attainder, was forfeited. No question
he had other such young....</p>

<p>From Dr. John Pell:&mdash;In his youthfull time, was one
Charles Chester, that often kept company with his
acquaintance; he was a bold impertenent fellowe, and they
could never be at quiet for him; a perpetuall talker, and
made a noyse like a drumme in a roome. So one time at
a taverne Sir W. R. beates him and seales up his mouth
(i.e. his upper and neather beard) with hard wax. From
him Ben Johnson takes his Carlo Buffono (i.e. 'jester') in
<i>Every Man out of his Humour</i>.</p>

<p><a name="FNanchor_799_1008" id="FNanchor_799_1008"></a><a href="#Footnote_799_1008" class="fnanchor">[799]</a>He was a second to the earle of Oxford in a duell.
Was acquainted and accepted with all the hero's of our
nation in his time.</p>

<p>Sir Walter Long, of Dracot (grandfather to this old Sir
James Long) maried a daughter of Sir John Thynne, by
which meanes, and their consimility of disposition, there
was a very conjunct friendship between the two brothers
(Sir Carew and Sir Walter) and him; and old John Long,
who then wayted on Sir W. Long, being one time in the
Privy-Garden with his master, saw the earle of Nottingham
wipe the dust from Sir Walter R.'s shoes with his
cloake, in compliment.</p>


<h4>&lt;<i>Portraits of him.</i>&gt;</h4>

<p>In the great parlour at Downton, at Mr. Ralegh's, is
a good piece (an originall) of Sir W. in a white sattin
doublet, all embrodered with rich pearles, and a mighty
rich chaine of great pearles about his neck, and the old
servants have told me that the pearles were neer as big as
the painted ones.</p>

<p>He had a most remarkeable aspect, an exceeding<a name="FNanchor_800_1009" id="FNanchor_800_1009"></a><a href="#Footnote_800_1009" class="fnanchor">[800]</a> high
forehead, long-faced, and sour eie-lidded, a kind of pigge-eie.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>N.B.&mdash;At ... an obscure taverne, in Drury-lane (a
bayliff's), is a good picture of this worthy, and also of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>others of his time; taken upon some execution (I suppose)
formerly.</p>


<h4>&lt;<i>Miscellaneous anecdotes.</i>&gt;</h4>

<p><a name="FNanchor_801_1010" id="FNanchor_801_1010"></a><a href="#Footnote_801_1010" class="fnanchor">[801]</a>I have heard old major Cosh say that Sir W. Raleigh
did not care to goe on the Thames in a wherry boate: he
would rather goe round about over London bridg.</p>

<p><a name="FNanchor_802_1011" id="FNanchor_802_1011"></a><a href="#Footnote_802_1011" class="fnanchor">[802]</a>My old friend James Harrington, esq. [Oceana] was
well acquainted with Sir Benjamin Ruddyer, who was an
acquaintance of Sir Walter Ralegh's. He told Mr. J. H.
that Sir Walter Ralegh being invited to dinner to some
great person where his son was to goe with him, he sayd
to his son 'Thou art expected to-day at dinner to goe along
with me, but thou art such a quarrelsome<a name="FNanchor_803_1012" id="FNanchor_803_1012"></a><a href="#Footnote_803_1012" class="fnanchor">[803]</a>, affronting ...<a name="FNanchor_804_1013" id="FNanchor_804_1013"></a><a href="#Footnote_804_1013" class="fnanchor">[804]</a>,
that I am ashamed to have such a beare in my company.'
Mr. Walter humbled himselfe to his father, and promised
he would behave himselfe mighty mannerly. So away they
went (and Sir Benjamin, I think, with them). He sate
next to his father and was very demure at least halfe
dinner time. Then sayd he, 'I, this morning, not having
the feare of God before my eies but by the instigation of
the devill, went<a name="FNanchor_805_1014" id="FNanchor_805_1014"></a><a href="#Footnote_805_1014" class="fnanchor">[805]</a>....' Sir Walter being strangely surprized
and putt out of his countenance at so great a table, gives
his son a damned blow over the face. His son, as rude as
he was, would not strike his father, but strikes over the face
the gentleman that sate next to him and sayd 'Box about:
'twill come to my father anon.' 'Tis now a common-used
proverb.</p>

earle of Salisbury, who died in a ditch 3 or 4 miles west
from Marleborough, returning from Bathe to London, which
was printed in an 8vo booke about 1656 (perhaps one of
Mr. Osborne's):&mdash;</p>

<h4>&lt;<i>Raleigh in James I's reign.</i>&gt;</h4>

<p><a name="FNanchor_810_1019" id="FNanchor_810_1019"></a><a href="#Footnote_810_1019" class="fnanchor">[810]</a>I have now forgott (vide History) whether Sir Walter
was not for the putting of Mary, queen of Scotts, to death;
I thinke, yea. But, besides that, at a consultation at
Whitehall, after queen Elizabeth's death, how matters<a name="FNanchor_811_1020" id="FNanchor_811_1020"></a><a href="#Footnote_811_1020" class="fnanchor">[811]</a>
were to be ordered and what ought to be donne, Sir
Walter Raleigh declared his opinion, 'twas the wisest way
for them to keep the government<a name="FNanchor_812_1021" id="FNanchor_812_1021"></a><a href="#Footnote_812_1021" class="fnanchor">[812]</a> in their owne hands,
and sett up a commonwealth, and not be subject to a needy
beggerly nation. It seemes there were some of this caball<a name="FNanchor_813_1022" id="FNanchor_813_1022"></a><a href="#Footnote_813_1022" class="fnanchor">[813]</a>
who kept not this so secret but that it came to king
James's eare; who at ... (vide <i>Chronicle</i>) where the
English noblesse mett and recieved him, being told upon
their presentment to his majesty their names, when Sir
Walter Raleigh's name was told ('Ralegh') said the king
'On my soule, mon, I have heard <i>rawly</i> of thee.'&mdash;He
was such a person (every way) that (as King Charles I
sayes of the lord Strafford) a prince would rather be afrayd
of then ashamed of. He had that awfulnes and ascendency
in his aspect over other mortalls, that the king....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span></p>

<p>It was a most stately sight, the glory of that reception
of his majesty, where the nobility and gentry were in
exceeding rich equippage, having enjoyed a long peace
under the most excellent of queens; and the company<a name="FNanchor_814_1023" id="FNanchor_814_1023"></a><a href="#Footnote_814_1023" class="fnanchor">[814]</a>
was so exceeding numerous that their obedience<a name="FNanchor_815_1024" id="FNanchor_815_1024"></a><a href="#Footnote_815_1024" class="fnanchor">[815]</a> carried
a secret dread with it. King James did not inwardly like
it, and with an inward envy sayd that, though so and so
(as before), he doubted not but he should have been able on
his owne strength (should the English have kept him out)
been able to have dealt with them, and get his right.
<a name="FNanchor_LXXII._125" id="FNanchor_LXXII._125"></a><a href="#Footnote_LXXII._125" class="fnanchor">[LXXII.]</a>Sayd Sir Walter Raleigh to him, 'Would to
God that had been put to the tryall.' 'Why
doe you wish that?' sayd the king.&mdash;'Because,' said Sir
Walter, 'that then you would have knowne your friends
from your foes.' But that reason of Sir Walter was never
forgotten nor forgiven.</p>

<p>As for his noble design in Guiana, vide the printed

showed me, where is mention of captaine North (brother
to the lord North) who went with Sir Walter, where is
a large account of these matters. Mr. Edmund Wyld

wont to say that he was a coward to be so taken and
conveyed, for els he might easily have made his escape
from so slight a guard.</p>


<h4>&lt;<i>His imprisonment, death, and burial.</i>&gt;</h4>

<p>He was prisoner in the Tower ... (quaere) yeares;
quaere where his lodgeings were?</p>

<p>He there (besides his compiling his <i>History of the
World</i>) studyed chymistry. The earle of Northumberland
was prisoner at the same time, who was the patrone to
Mr. ... Harriot and Mr. Warner, two of the best mathematicians
then in the world, as also Mr. Hues (&lt;who wrote&gt;
<i>de Globis</i>). Serjeant Hoskins (the poet) was a prisoner
there too.</p>

<p>I heard my cosen Whitney say that he saw him in the
Tower. He had a velvet cap laced, and a rich gowne, and
trunke hose.</p>

<p><a name="FNanchor_826_1035" id="FNanchor_826_1035"></a><a href="#Footnote_826_1035" class="fnanchor">[826]</a>He was scandalizd with atheisme; but he was a bold
man, and would venture at discourse which was unpleasant
to the church-men. I remember &lt;the&gt; first lord<a name="FNanchor_827_1036" id="FNanchor_827_1036"></a><a href="#Footnote_827_1036" class="fnanchor">[827]</a> Scudamour
sayd ''twas basely sayd of Sir W. R., to talke
of <i>the anagramme of Dog</i>.' In his speech on the scaffold,
I heard my cosen Whitney say (and I thinke 'tis printed)
that he spake not one word of Christ, but of the great and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>incomprehensible God, with much zeale and adoration, so
that he concluded he was an a-christ, not an atheist.</p>

<p>He tooke<a name="FNanchor_LXXIV._127" id="FNanchor_LXXIV._127"></a><a href="#Footnote_LXXIV._127" class="fnanchor">[LXXIV.]</a> a pipe of tobacco a little before
he went to the scaffold, which some formall
persons were scandalized at, but I thinke 'twas well and
properly donne, to settle his spirits.</p>

<p>I remember I heard old father ... Symonds (&egrave; Societate

to his knowledge he dyed with a lye in his mouth: I have
now forgott what 'twas. The time of his execution was
contrived to be on my Lord Mayer's day (viz. the day after
St. Simon and Jude) 1618, that the pageants and fine
shewes might drawe away<a name="FNanchor_829_1038" id="FNanchor_829_1038"></a><a href="#Footnote_829_1038" class="fnanchor">[829]</a> the people from beholding the
tragoedie of one of the gallants worthies that ever England
bred. Buryed privately under the high alter at St.
Margaret's church, in Westminster, on ... (vide Register);
in which grave (or neer) lies James Harrington, esq., author
of <i>Oceana</i>.</p>

<p>Mr. Elias Ashmole told me that his son Carew Ralegh
told him he had his father's skull; that some yeares since,
upon digging-up the grave, his skull and neck-bone being
viewed, they found the bone<a name="FNanchor_830_1039" id="FNanchor_830_1039"></a><a href="#Footnote_830_1039" class="fnanchor">[830]</a> of his neck lapped over so, that
he could not have been hanged. Quaere Sir John Elowys for
the skull, who married Mr. Carew Ralegh's daughter and
heire.</p>

him many yeares in life though now above 3-score yeares
old, if it had not been taken away by the hand of violence.
And this was the end of the great Sir Walter Raleigh,

that low degree of poverty that Mr. Philips told me that
he swept the yard at Whitehall and that he himselfe sawe

<p>Walter Rumsey, of Lanover, in com. Monmouth, esquier
(borne there), was of &lt;Gloucester Hall&gt; in Oxon; afterwards
of the society of Graye's Inne, where he was a bencher.</p>

<p>He was one of the judges in South Wales, viz. Caermarthen,
Pembrokeshire, and Cardigan circuit. He was
so excellent a lawyer, that he was called <i>The Picklock of
the Lawe</i>.</p>

<p>He was an ingeniose man, and had a philosophicall
head; he was most curious for graffing, inoculating, and
planting, and ponds. If he had any old dead plumbe-tree,
or apple-tree, he lett them stand, and planted vines at the
bottome, and lett them climbe up, and they would beare
very well.</p>

<p>He was one of my councell in my law-suites in Breconshire
about the entaile. He had a kindnesse for me and
invited me to his house, and told me a great many fine
things, both naturall and antiquarian.</p>

<p>He was very facetious, and a good musitian, playd on
the organ and lute. He could compose.</p>

<p>He was much troubled with flegme, and being so one
winter at the court at Ludlowe (where he was one of the
councesellours), sitting by the fire, spitting and spawling,
he tooke a fine tender sprig, and tied<a name="FNanchor_907_1116" id="FNanchor_907_1116"></a><a href="#Footnote_907_1116" class="fnanchor">[907]</a> a ragge at the end,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>and conceited he might putt it downe his throate, and
fetch-up the flegme, and he did so. Afterwards he made
this instrument of whale-bone. I have oftentimes seen him
use it. I could never make it goe downe my throat, but
for those that can 'tis a most incomparable engine. If
troubled with the wind it cures you <i>immediately</i>. It
makes you vomit without any paine, and besides, the
vomits of apothecaries have <i>aliquid veneni</i> in them. He
wrote a little 8vo booke, of this way of medicine, called
<i>Organon Salutis</i>: London, printed for Daniel Pakeman, at
the Rainebowe, in Fleet-street, 1659, scil. the second edition,
dedicated to Henry &lt;Pierrepont&gt;, marquess of Dorchester.
I had a young fellow (Marc Collins), that was my servant,
that used it incomparably, more easily than the Judge; he
made of them. In Wilts, among my things, are some of
his making still. The Judge sayd he never sawe any one
use it so dextrously in his life. It is no paine, when downe
your throate; he would touch the bottome of his stomach
with it. There is praefixt a letter from the Judge to Sir
Henry Blount, knight; to which is annexed Sir Henry
Blount's ingeniose answer.</p>

(<i>a</i>) MS. Aubr. 8 was written in 1681, 'this earl' is therefore Charles, 6th earl
(succeeded 1677, died 1706); but Aubrey twice calls him <i>Richard</i>. (<i>b</i>) The
translation of <i>the Cid</i> appeared, part i in 1637, and part ii in 1640. It was
executed by Joseph Rutter (tutor to Richard, 5th earl) at the command of
Edward, 4th earl; and therefore the attribution of the translation should be to
Edward, 4th earl, who died 1652.</p></div>

<p><a name="FNanchor_927_1136" id="FNanchor_927_1136"></a><a href="#Footnote_927_1136" class="fnanchor">[927]</a>Dr. Robert Sanderson<a name="FNanchor_BD_136" id="FNanchor_BD_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_BD_136" class="fnanchor">[BD]</a>, lord bishop of Lincoln, would
confesse to his intimate friends, that 'he studied and
mastered only Tully's Offices<a name="FNanchor_LXXX._135" id="FNanchor_LXXX._135"></a><a href="#Footnote_LXXX._135" class="fnanchor">[LXXX.]</a>, Tho. Aquinas's

and that all other bookes he read but cursorily':
but he had forgott, by his favour, to speake of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>Aristot. Organon, etc. (Logique bookes), els he could never
have compiled his owne excellent Logique,&mdash;from Seth
Ward, bishop of Sarum, and &lt;John&gt; Pierson, bishop of
Chester, his great friends. And bishop Ward sayd that
he<a name="FNanchor_928_1137" id="FNanchor_928_1137"></a><a href="#Footnote_928_1137" class="fnanchor">[928]</a> would doe the like were he to begin the world again.</p>

Harsenet, archbishop
of Yorke,
alwayes carried
it in his bosome.</p></div>

<p>He was a lover of musique, and was wont to play on
his base violl, and also to sing to it. He was a lover of
heraldry, and gave it in chardge in his articles of enquiry;
but the clergie-men made him such a lamentable imperfect
returne that it signified nothing. The very Parliamentarians
reverenced him for his learning and his vertue, so that he
alwayes kept his living, quod N.B. (the information in the
Oxon. Antiq.<a name="FNanchor_BE_137" id="FNanchor_BE_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_BE_137" class="fnanchor">[BE]</a> was false).</p>

<p>He had no great memorie, I am certaine not a sure one;
when I was a fresh-man and heard him read his first
lecture, he was out in the Lord's Prayer. He alwayes
read his sermons and lectures. Had his memorie been
greater his judgement had been lesse: they are like two
well-bucketts.</p>

<p>In his Logique, he recommends disputation to young
men, as the best exercise for young witts. Under his
picture, before his booke, is 'Aetat. 76, 1662.'</p>

<h3><b>Sir Henry Savile</b> (1549-1621/2).</h3>


<p><a name="FNanchor_933_1142" id="FNanchor_933_1142"></a><a href="#Footnote_933_1142" class="fnanchor">[933]</a>Sir Henry Savill<a name="FNanchor_BF_139" id="FNanchor_BF_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_BF_139" class="fnanchor">[BF]</a>, knight, was borne in Yorkshire
(vide A. Wood's <i>Antiq. Oxon.</i>).... He was a younger
(or &lt;son&gt; of a younger) brother, not borne to a foot of
land. He came to Merton Coll. Oxon. &lt;1565&gt;; made
Warden there &lt;1585&gt;.</p>

<p>He was a learned gentleman, as most was of his time.
He would faine have been thought (I have heard Mr. Hobbes
say) to have been as great a scholar as Joseph Scaliger.
But as for mathematiques, I have heard Dr. Wallis say
that he look't on him to be as able a mathematician as
any of his time. He was an extraordinary handsome and
beautifull man; no lady had a finer complexion.</p>

<p>Queen Elizabeth favoured him much; he read (I think)
Greeke and Politiques to her. He was also preferred to
be Provost of Eaton colledge &lt;1596&gt;.</p>

<p>He was a very severe governour, the scholars hated him
for his austerity. He could not abide <i>witts</i>: when a
young scholar was recommended to him for a good witt,
'<i>Out upon him, I'le have nothing to doe with him; give me
the ploding student. If I would look for witts I would goe to
Newgate, there be the witts</i><a name="FNanchor_LXXXI._138" id="FNanchor_LXXXI._138"></a><a href="#Footnote_LXXXI._138" class="fnanchor">[LXXXI.]</a>;' and John Earles
(afterwards bishop of Sarum) was the only
scholar that ever he tooke as recommended for
a witt, which was from Dr. &lt;William&gt; Goodwyn, &lt;dean&gt;
of Christ Church.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_LXXXI._138" id="Footnote_LXXXI._138"></a><a href="#FNanchor_LXXXI._138"><span class="label">[LXXXI.]</span></a> This I was
told<a name="FNanchor_BG_140" id="FNanchor_BG_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_BG_140" class="fnanchor">[BG]</a> by Robert
Skinner, bishop
of Oxon, 1646.</p></div>

<p>He was not only a severe governor, but old Mr. Yates<a name="FNanchor_BH_141" id="FNanchor_BH_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_BH_141" class="fnanchor">[BH]</a>
(who was fellow in his time) would make lamentable complaints
of him to his dyeing day, that he did oppresse the
fellows grievously, and he was so great and a favourite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
to the Queen, that there was no dealing with him; his
naeve was that he was too much inflated with his learning
and riches.</p>

<p>He was very munificent, as appeares by the two lectures
he has given of Astronomy and Geometry. Bishop Seth
Ward, of Sarum, has told me that he first sent for
Mr. &lt;Edmund&gt; Gunter, from London, (being of Oxford
university) to have been his<a name="FNanchor_934_1143" id="FNanchor_934_1143"></a><a href="#Footnote_934_1143" class="fnanchor">[934]</a> Professor of Geometrie: so
he came and brought with him his sector and quadrant,
and fell to resolving of triangles and doeing a great many
fine things. Said the grave knight, '<i>Doe you call this reading
of Geometrie? This is shewing of tricks, man!</i>' and so
dismisst him with scorne, and sent for &lt;Henry&gt; Briggs,
from Cambridge.</p>

<p>I have heard Dr. Wallis say, that Sir H. Savill has
sufficiently confuted Joseph Scaliger de Quadratura Circuli,
in the very margent of the booke: and that sometimes
when J. Scaliger sayes 'A B = C D ex constructione,' Sir
H. Savill writes sometimes in the margent, 'Et dominatio
vestra est asinus ex constructione.'</p>

<p>He left only one daughter, which was<a name="FNanchor_935_1144" id="FNanchor_935_1144"></a><a href="#Footnote_935_1144" class="fnanchor">[935]</a>maried to
Sir ... Sedley, of ... in Kent, mother to this present
Sir Charles Sedley, who well resembles his grandfather
Savill in the face, but is not so proper a man.</p>

<p>Sir H. Savill dyed at, and was buried at Eaton colledge,
in the chapell, on the south east side of the chancell, under
a faire black marble grave-stone, with this inscription:&mdash;</p>

<hr class="tb" />
<hr class="tb" />


<p>He had travelled very well, and had a generall acquaintance
with the learned men abroad; by which meanes
he obtained from beyond sea, out of their libraries, severall
rare Greeke MSS., which he had copied by an excellent
amanuensis for the Greeke character.</p>

<p>... putt a trick upon him, for he gott a friend to send
him weekely over to ... in Flanders (I thinke), the
sheetes of the curious Chrysostome that were printed at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>Eaton, and translated them into Latin, and printed them
Greeke and Latin together, which quite spoyled the sale
of Sir Henry's.</p>

<p>Memorandum:&mdash;he gave his collection of mathematicall
bookes to a peculiar little library belonging to the Savillian
Professors<a name="FNanchor_BI_142" id="FNanchor_BI_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_BI_142" class="fnanchor">[BI]</a>.</p>

<h3><b>Sylvanus Scory</b> (15&mdash; -1617).</h3>


<p><a name="FNanchor_936_1145" id="FNanchor_936_1145"></a><a href="#Footnote_936_1145" class="fnanchor">[936]</a>Sylvanus Scory (quaere if he was not knighted?) was
the son and heire of &lt;John&gt; Scory, bishop of Hereford.</p>

<p>His father, John Skory, in the raigne of King Edward
the Sixt, was bishop of Rochester, and translated from
thence to Chichester, and afterwards to Hereford; 'who
departed this life, at his house, at Whitburn, in com.
Hereff., 26 Junii, Anno Domini 1585'&mdash;this out of an
epitaph on his wife Elizabeth, who hath an inscription
in St. Leonard's Shoreditch church.</p>

<p>He was a very handsome gentleman, and had an excellent
witt, and his father gave him the best education, both
at home and beyond the seas, that that age would afford,
and loved him so dearly that he fleeced the church of
Hereford to leave him a good estate, and he did let such
long, and so many, leases, that, as M<sup>ris</sup> Masters (daughter
of Herbert Westphaling, esq., eldest son and heir to bishop
Westphaling, of Hereford) told me, they were not out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
till about these 60 yeares. To my best remembrance,
she told me the estate left him was 1500 <i>li.</i> per annum,
which he reduced to nothing (alloweing himselfe the
libertie to enjoy all the pleasures of this world), and
left his sonne so poor, that when he came among gentlemen,
they would fancy a crowne or ten shillings<a name="FNanchor_937_1146" id="FNanchor_937_1146"></a><a href="#Footnote_937_1146" class="fnanchor">[937]</a> for him.</p>

<p>I have heard Sir John Denham say (at Chalke, 1652),
that he haz been well enformed that he was the most
accomplished gentleman of his time. 'Tis a good testimoniall
of his worth, that Mr. Benjamin Johnson (who ever scorned
an unworthy patrone) dedicated his ... to him. I have
heard Sir John Denham also say that he was the greatest
confident and intimate favorite of Monsieur of France
(brother to the French king), who was a suitor to queen
Elizabeth, and whom her majestie entirely loved (and as
a signall of it one time at St. Paule's church, London,
openly kissed him in time of divine service) and would
have had him for her husband, but only for reasons of
state. When her majestie dismissed him, 'twas donne with
all passion and respecte imaginable. She gave him royall
presents; he was attended to Dover by the flower of the
court; among others, by this sparke of whom I now
write. When Monsieur tooke his leave of him he told him
that though 'twas so that her majestie could not marie
him (as aforesayd), yet he knew that she so much loved
him that she would not deny him any request, wherby he
might honour and benefit a friend; and accordingly writes
his love-letter to his mistresse, the queen of England, and
in it only begges that single <i>b&ocirc;n</i><a name="FNanchor_938_1147" id="FNanchor_938_1147"></a><a href="#Footnote_938_1147" class="fnanchor">[938]</a>, to looke upon Mr. Scorie
(the bearer) with a particular and extraordinary grace, for

him a jewell). As Sylvanus returned to London, through
Canterbury, the mayer there (a shoemaker), a pragmaticall
fellow, examined him, who and whence, etc. and what
his business was, and if he had a passe? 'Yes,' quod he,
'I have a passe,' and produces Monsieur's letter, super<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>scribed

how, this action happened to take wind, and 'twas
brought to court, and became so ridicule that Sylvanus
Scory was so laughed at and jeer'd that he never delivered
the letter to the queen, which had been the easiest and most
honourable step to preferment that mortall man could
have desired.</p>

Sir Robert Cotton&mdash;from Fabian Philips.</p>

epitaph, which he himselfe made, as I well remember
archbishop Usher, Lord Primate, who did preach his
funerall sermon, did then mention scil. as to <i>spe certae
resurrectionis</i>) at Salvinton, a hamlet belonging to West
Terring, in the com. of Sussex.</p>

<p>His father was a yeomanly man, of about fourty pounds
per annum, and played well on the violin, in which he
tooke delight, and at Christmas time, to please him selfe
and his neighbours, he would play to them as they
danced. My old lady Cotton<a name="FNanchor_LXXXII._143" id="FNanchor_LXXXII._143"></a><a href="#Footnote_LXXXII._143" class="fnanchor">[LXXXII.]</a> (wife to Sir
Robert Cotton, grandmother to this Sir &lt;John&gt;
Cotton) was one time at Sir Thomas Alford's,
in Sussex, at dinner, in Christmas time, and
Mr. John Selden (then a young student) sate
at the lower end of the table, who was lookt
upon then to be of parts extraordinary, and
some body asking who he was, 'twas replyed,
his son that is playing on the violin &lt;in&gt; the

Malet's son) say, that he had heard that Mr. John Selden's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>father taught on the lute. He had a pretty good estate by
his wife.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_LXXXIII._144" id="Footnote_LXXXIII._144"></a><a href="#FNanchor_LXXXIII._144"><span class="label">[LXXXIII.]</span></a> This from
Sir William
Dugdale, from
the lady Cotton.&mdash;Mr.
Fabian
Philips told
me that when
J. Selden was
young he did
copie records
for Sir Robert
Cotton.</p></div>

<p>He (vide A. Wood's <i>Antiq. Oxon.</i>) was of Hart-hall in
Oxon, and Sir Giles Mompesson told me that he was then
of that house<a name="FNanchor_BK_148" id="FNanchor_BK_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_BK_148" class="fnanchor">[BK]</a>, and that he was a long scabby-pold boy,
but a good student.</p>

<p>Thence he came to the Inner Temple. His chamber
was in the paper buildings which looke towards the garden, ...
staire-case, uppermost story, where he had a little
gallery to walke in.</p>

<p>He was quickly taken notice of for his learning, and
was sollicitor and steward to the earl of Kent<a name="FNanchor_BL_149" id="FNanchor_BL_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_BL_149" class="fnanchor">[BL]</a>, whose
countesse (was) an ingeniose woman....<a name="FNanchor_949_1158" id="FNanchor_949_1158"></a><a href="#Footnote_949_1158" class="fnanchor">[949]</a> After the earle's
death he married her. He had a daughter<a name="FNanchor_950_1159" id="FNanchor_950_1159"></a><a href="#Footnote_950_1159" class="fnanchor">[950]</a>, if not two, by ...;
one was maried to a tradesman in Bristowe.... Mris.
Williamson, one of my lady's woemen, a lusty, bouncing
woman, ... robbed him on his death-bed....</p>

<p>His great friend heretofore was Mr. ... Hayward,
to whom he dedicates his <i>Titles of Honour</i>; also Ben
Johnson.</p>

<p>His treatise that Tythes were not <i>jure divino</i> drew<a name="FNanchor_951_1160" id="FNanchor_951_1160"></a><a href="#Footnote_951_1160" class="fnanchor">[951]</a> a
great deale of envy upon him from the clergie. W. Laud,
archbishop of Canterbury, made him make his recantation
before the High Commission Court, of which you may
have an account in Dr. Peter Heylen's Historie. After,
he would never forgive the bishops, but did still in his
writings levell them with the presbyterie. He was also
severe and bitter in his speeches against ship-money,
which speeches see.</p>

<p>He was one of the Assembly of Divines, and &lt;Bulstrode&gt;
Whitlock, in his memoires, sayes that he was wont to
mock the Assembly men about their little gilt Bibles, and
would baffle them sadly: sayd he, 'I doe consider the
original.'</p>

<p><a name="FNanchor_952_1161" id="FNanchor_952_1161"></a><a href="#Footnote_952_1161" class="fnanchor">[952]</a>&lt;Richard&gt; Montague, &lt;bishop&gt; of Norwich, was his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>great antagonist; vide the bookes writt against each
other.</p>

<p>He never owned the mariage with the countesse of
Kent till after her death, upon some lawe account. He
never kept any servant peculiar, but my ladie's were all
at his command; he lived with her <i>in Aedibus Carmeliticis</i>
(White Fryers), which was, before the conflagration, a noble
dwelling.</p>

<p>He kept a plentifull table, and was never without learned
company. He rose at ... clock in the morning (quaere
Sir J. C.<a name="FNanchor_BM_150" id="FNanchor_BM_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_BM_150" class="fnanchor">[BM]</a>) and went to bed at....</p>

<p>He was temperate in eating and drinking. He had a
slight stuffe, or silke, kind of false carpet, to cast<a name="FNanchor_953_1162" id="FNanchor_953_1162"></a><a href="#Footnote_953_1162" class="fnanchor">[953]</a> over
the table where he read and his papers lay<a name="FNanchor_954_1163" id="FNanchor_954_1163"></a><a href="#Footnote_954_1163" class="fnanchor">[954]</a>, when a
stranger came-in, so that he needed not to displace<a name="FNanchor_955_1164" id="FNanchor_955_1164"></a><a href="#Footnote_955_1164" class="fnanchor">[955]</a> his
bookes or papers.</p>

<p>He wrote ...: vide A. Wood's <i>Antiq. Oxon.</i> for the
catalogue of the bookes writt by him.</p>

<p>He dyed of a dropsey; he had his funerall scutcheons
all ready ... moneths before he dyed.</p>

<p>When he was neer death, the minister (Mr. &lt;Richard&gt;
Johnson) was comeing to him to assoile him: Mr. Hobbes
happened then to be there; sayd he, 'What, will you
that have wrote like a man, now dye like a woman?' So
the minister was not let in.</p>

<p>He dyed <i>in Aedibus Carmeliticis</i> (aforesayd) the last
day of November, Anno Domini 1654; and on Thursday,
the 14th day of December, was magnificently buryed in the
Temple church. His executors were Matthew Hales
(since Lord Chiefe Justice of the King's Bench), John
Vaughan (since Lord Chief Justice of the Common Pleas),
and Rowland Jewkes, Esq.: quaere the fourth executor<a name="FNanchor_BN_151" id="FNanchor_BN_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_BN_151" class="fnanchor">[BN]</a>.
They invited all the Parliament men, all the benchers, and
great officers. All the judges had<a name="FNanchor_956_1165" id="FNanchor_956_1165"></a><a href="#Footnote_956_1165" class="fnanchor">[956]</a> mourning, as also an
abundance of persons of quality. The Lord Primate of
Ireland, &lt;James&gt; Usher, preach't his funerall sermon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span></p>

<p>His grave was about ten foot deepe or better, walled up
a good way with bricks, of which also the bottome was
paved, but the sides at the bottome for about two foot
high were of black polished marble, wherein his coffin
(covered with black bayes) lyeth, and upon that wall
of marble was presently lett downe a huge black marble
stone of great thicknesse, with this inscription:</p>

<p class="center"><i>Heic jacet corpus Johannis Seldeni, qui<br />
obiit 30 die Novembris, 1654.</i>
</p>

<p>Over this was turned an arch of brick (for the house
would not loose their grownd), and upon that was throwne
the earth, etc. and on the surface lieth another faire grave-stone
of black marble, with this inscription:</p>

<p class="center">I. SELDENVS, I. C. <i>heic situs est</i>.
</p>

<p>This coate<a name="FNanchor_957_1166" id="FNanchor_957_1166"></a><a href="#Footnote_957_1166" class="fnanchor">[957]</a> ('..., 3 roses on a fess, between 3 swans'
necks, erased, collared' [this is the coate of Baker]) is on
the flatt marble; but is, indeed, the coate of his mother,
for he had none of his owne, though he so well deserved
it. 'Tis strange (me thinke) that he would not have one.</p>

<p>On the side of the wall above, is a faire<a name="FNanchor_958_1167" id="FNanchor_958_1167"></a><a href="#Footnote_958_1167" class="fnanchor">[958]</a> inscription
of white marble: the epitaph he made himselfe as is
before sayd, and Marchamond Needham, making mention
of it in his <i>Mercurius Politicus</i>, sayd 'twas well he did it,
for no man els could doe it for him. He was buried by
Mr. &lt;Richard&gt; Johnson, then Master of the Temple, the
directory way, where Mr. Johnson tooke an occasion to
say<a name="FNanchor_BO_152" id="FNanchor_BO_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_BO_152" class="fnanchor">[BO]</a>, 'a learned man sayes that when a learned man dies
a great deale of learning dies with him: then certainly in
this,' etc.</p>

<p>He would tell his intimate friends, Sir Bennet Hoskyns,
etc., that he had nobody to make his heire, except it
were a milke-mayd, and that such people did not know
what to doe with a great estate. Memorandum:&mdash;bishop
Grostest, of Lincoln, told his brother, who asked him to
make him a grate man; 'Brother,' said he, 'if your plough
is broken, I'le pay the mending of it; or if an oxe is dead,
I'le pay for another: but a plough-man I found you, and
a plough-man I'le leave you'&mdash;Fuller's <i>Holy State</i>, p....</p>

<p>He never used any artificiall help to strengthen his
memorie: 'twas purely naturall.</p>

<p>He was very tall, I guesse about 6 foot high;
sharp ovall face; head not very big; long nose
inclining to one side; full popping eie (gray).
He was a poet<a name="FNanchor_LXXXIV._145" id="FNanchor_LXXXIV._145"></a><a href="#Footnote_LXXXIV._145" class="fnanchor">[LXXXIV.]</a>, and Sir John Suckling brings

<p>He was one of the assembly of divines in those
dayes (as was also his highnesse ... Prince Elector<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
Palatine<a name="FNanchor_BP_153" id="FNanchor_BP_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_BP_153" class="fnanchor">[BP]</a>), and was like a thorne in their sides; for he

them all downe with his Greeke and antiquities.</p>

<p>Sir Robert Cotton (the great antiquary, that collected
the library) was his great friend, whose son, Sir Thomas
Cotton, was obnoxious to the Parliament, and
skulked in the countrey: Mr. Selden had the
key and command of the library, and preserved
it, being then a Parliament man.</p>

<p>He intended to have given his owne library
to the University of Oxford<a name="FNanchor_LXXXV._146" id="FNanchor_LXXXV._146"></a><a href="#Footnote_LXXXV._146" class="fnanchor">[LXXXV.]</a>, but received disobligation
from them, for that they would not
lend him some MSS.; wherfore by his will he left it to
the disposall of his executors, who gave it to the Bodlean
library, at Oxon.</p>

says that Mr.
Selden had
given his library
to Oxford at
first, but that
the University
had disobliged
&lt;him&gt; by not
lending him a
MS. or MSS.</p></div>

<p>He understood ... languages:&mdash;Latin, Greeke,
Hebrew, Arabique, besides the learned modern.</p>

<p>In his writing of ... he used his learned friend,
Mr. Henry Jacob, of Merton College, who did transcribe
etc. for him, and as he was writing, would many times
putt-in things of his owne head, which Mr. Selden did let
stand, as he does, in his preface, acknowledge.</p>

<p>In his younger yeares he affected obscurity of style,
which, after, he quite left off, and wrote perspicuously.
'Twill be granted that he was one of the greatest critiques
of his time.</p>

<p>I remember my sadler who wrought many yeares to
that family<a name="FNanchor_961_1170" id="FNanchor_961_1170"></a><a href="#Footnote_961_1170" class="fnanchor">[961]</a> told me that Mr. Selden had got more
by his marriage then he had done by his practise. He was
no eminent practiser at barre; not but that he was or
might have been able enough; but after he had got a
<i>dulce ocium</i> he chiefly addicted himselfe to his more
ingeniose studies and records.</p>

<p>I have heard some divines say (I know not if maliciously)
that 'twas true he was a man of great reading, but gave
not his owne sentiment.</p>

<p>He was wont to say 'I'le keepe myselfe warme and

notions came into his head, to preserve them, under his
barber's hands. When he dyed his barber sayd he had
a great mind to know his will, 'For,' sayd he, 'I never
knew a wise man make a wise will.' He bequeathed his
estate (40,000 <i>li.</i> value) to four executors, viz. Lord Chiefe
Justice Hales, Lord Chief Justice Vaughan, Rowland Jukes,

<h3><b>William Shakespear</b> (1564-1616).</h3>


<p><a name="FNanchor_963_1172" id="FNanchor_963_1172"></a><a href="#Footnote_963_1172" class="fnanchor">[963]</a>Mr. William Shakespear was borne at Stratford upon
Avon in the county of Warwick. His father was a butcher,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>and I have been told heretofore by some of the neighbours,
that when he was a boy he exercised his father's trade, but
when he kill'd a calfe he would doe it in a high style, and make
a speech. There was at that time another butcher's son
in this towne that was held not at all inferior to him for
a naturall witt, his acquaintance and coetanean, but dyed
young.</p>

<p>This William being inclined naturally to poetry and
acting, came to London, I guesse, about 18; and was an
actor at one of the play-houses, and did act exceedingly
well (now B. Johnson was never a good actor, but an
excellent instructor).</p>

<p>He began early to make essayes at dramatique poetry,
which at that time was very lowe; and his playes tooke well.</p>

<p>He was a handsome, well shap't man: very good company,
and of a very readie and pleasant smooth witt.</p>

<p>The humour of ... the constable, in <i>Midsomernight's
Dreame</i>, he happened to take at Grendon in Bucks&mdash;I
thinke it was Midsomer night that he happened to lye
there&mdash;which is the roade from London to Stratford, and
there was living that constable about 1642, when I first
came to Oxon: Mr. Josias Howe is of that parish, and
knew him. Ben Johnson and he did gather humours of
men dayly where ever they came. One time as he was at the
tavern at Stratford super Avon, one Combes, an old rich
usurer, was to be buryed, he makes there this extemporary
epitaph,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Ten in the hundred the Devill allowes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Combes will have twelve, he sweares and vowes:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If any one askes who lies in this tombe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Hoh!' quoth the Devill, ''Tis my John o Combe.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>He was wont to goe to his native countrey once a yeare.
I thinke I have been told that he left 2 or 300 <i>li.</i> per
annum there and thereabout to a sister. Vide his epitaph
in Dugdale's Warwickshire.</p>

<p>I have heard Sir William Davenant and Mr. Thomas
Shadwell (who is counted the best comoedian we have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
now) say that he had a most prodigious witt, and did
admire his naturall parts beyond all other dramaticall
writers. He was wont to say (B. Johnson's <i>Underwoods</i>)
that he 'never blotted out a line in his life'; sayd Ben:
Johnson, 'I wish he had blotted-out a thousand.'</p>

<p>His comoedies will remaine witt as long as the English
tongue is understood, for that he handles <i>mores hominum</i>.
Now our present writers reflect so much upon particular
persons and coxcombeities, that twenty yeares hence they
will not be understood.</p>

<p>Though, as Ben: Johnson sayes of him, that he had but
little Latine and lesse Greek, he understood Latine pretty
well, for he had been in his younger yeares a schoolmaster
in the countrey.&mdash;from Mr. ... Beeston<a name="FNanchor_964_1173" id="FNanchor_964_1173"></a><a href="#Footnote_964_1173" class="fnanchor">[964]</a>.</p>

<p>From Mr. Justice Ball<a name="FNanchor_984_1193" id="FNanchor_984_1193"></a><a href="#Footnote_984_1193" class="fnanchor">[984]</a> at Windsore:&mdash;when he was
about 10 or 12 he went to schoole to a curs't schoolmaster,
to whom he had an antipathie. His master would
discountenance him, and was very severe to him, and to
a dull boy he would say <i>as very a dunce as H. Spelman</i>.
He was a boy of great spirit, and would not learne there.
He was (upon his importunity) sent &lt;to&gt; another schoolmaster,
and profited very well. I have heard his grandson
say, that the Spelmans' witts open late.</p>

<p>He was much perplexed with lawe-suites and worldly
troubles, so that he was about 40 before he could settle
himselfe to make any great progresse in learning, which
when he did, we find what great monuments of antiquarian
knowledge he has left to the world. W. Laud, archbishop
of Canterbury, had a great esteeme for him, and made him
one of the ... of the High Commission Court; yet (he
being one that was extreme rigid as to the licensing of
bookes, and against any <i>nouvelle</i>) hindred the printing of
the 2d part of his Glossary, which began at M, where there
were three M's that scandalized the Archbishop, viz.&mdash;<i>Magna
Charta</i>; <i>Magnum Consilium Regis</i>; and....</p>

<p>From George Lee:&mdash;he was a handsome gentleman (as
appeares by his picture in Bibliotheca Cottoniana), strong
and valiant, and wore allwayes his sword, till he was about
70 or +, when, finding his legges to faulter through
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>feeblenes as he was walking, 'Now,' said he, ''tis time to
leave off my sword.'</p>

<p>When his daughter-in-lawe (Sir John's wife) returned
home from visitting her neighbours, he would alwaies aske
her what of antiquity she had heard or observed, and if
she brought home no such account, he would chide her
(jestingly).</p>

<p>He lies buried in the south crosse-aisle of Westminster
abbey, at the foot of the pillar opposite to Mr. Camden's
monument, but without any word of inscription or monument
hitherto (1680).<a name="FNanchor_985_1194" id="FNanchor_985_1194"></a><a href="#Footnote_985_1194" class="fnanchor">[985]</a>I very well remember his penon
that hung-up there, but it was either taken downe or fell
downe when the scaffolds were putt up at the coronation
of his majestie king Charles II.</p>

<p>Sir William Dugdale knew Sir Henry Spelman, and
sayes he was as tall as his grandson, Harry Spelman. He
haz been told that Sir Henry did not understand Latin
perfectly till he was fourty years old. He said to Sir
William, 'We are beholding to Mr. Speed and Stowe for
<i>stitching</i> up for us our English History.' It seemes they
were both taylers&mdash;quod N.B.</p>

Cossinet at the Anchor and Mariner in Tower Street,

<p>Before this appendix he writes thus, scilicet:&mdash;</p>

<p>'I doe here think it fitting for once publiquely to propose
unto all the world that by the farther blessing of God on my
astronomical studies since the publication of my <i>Astronomia
Carolina</i> I can discover and demonstrate the never yet
discovered art and science of finding &#9758; the true
longitude, and can make it universally practicable at sea
and land with the like ease and certainty as the latitude,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>and though the failings of severall specious pretenders to
this discovery have almost perswaded the world to believe
the impossibility thereof, if those that are most concerned
herein will accept of it, either upon the same termes which
them selves have already offered or other the like just and
proportionable considerations, this proposall shall be (God

two of his familiar acquaintance tell me that he did not
committ this discovery to paper: so it is dead with him.
He made attempts to be introduced to king Charles II and
also to king James II, but courtiers would not doe it
without a good gratuitie.</p>

<p>He was of a rough and cholerique humour. Discoursing
with prince Rupert, his highnesse affirmed something that
was not according to art; sayd Mr. Street, 'whoever
affirmes that is<a name="FNanchor_1013_1222" id="FNanchor_1013_1222"></a><a href="#Footnote_1013_1222" class="fnanchor">[1013]</a> no mathematician.' So they would point

&lt;Sir John&gt; Suckling, of the Green Cloath, tempore<a name="FNanchor_1020_1229" id="FNanchor_1020_1229"></a><a href="#Footnote_1020_1229" class="fnanchor">[1020]</a> ...
(I thinke, Car. I). His mother was the daughter of....
He was borne &lt;Febr. 1608/9&gt;.</p>

<p>I have heard Mris Bond say, that Sir John's father was
but a dull fellow (her husband, Mr. Thomas Bond, knew
him): the witt came by the mother.</p>

<p>Quaere Dr. Busby if he was not of Westminster schoole?
he might be about his time. I have heard Sir William
Davenant say that he went to the university of Cambridge
at eleaven yeares of age, where he studied three or four
yeares (I thinke, four). By 18 he had well travelled France
and Italie, and part of Germany, and (I thinke also) of
Spaine.</p>

<p>He returned into England an extraordinary accomplished
gentleman, grew famous at court for his readie sparkling
witt which was envyed, and he was (Sir William sayd) the
bull that was bayted. He was incomparably readie at
repartyng, and his witt most sparkling when most sett-upon
and provoked.</p>

<p>He was the greatest gallant of his time, and the greatest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>gamester, both for bowling<a name="FNanchor_LXXXVII._159" id="FNanchor_LXXXVII._159"></a><a href="#Footnote_LXXXVII._159" class="fnanchor">[LXXXVII.]</a> and cards, so that no shop-keeper
would trust him for 6<i>d.</i>, as to-day, for
instance, he might, by winning, be worth 200 <i>li.</i>,
the next day he might not be worth half so
much, or perhaps be sometimes <i>minus nihilo</i>.
Sir William (who was his intimate friend, and
loved him intirely) would say that Sir John,
when he was at his lowest ebbe in gameing,
I meane when unfortunate, then would make
himselfe most glorious in apparell, and sayd
that it exalted his spirits, and that he had
then best luck when he was most gallant, and
his spirits were highest.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_LXXXVII._159" id="Footnote_LXXXVII._159"></a><a href="#FNanchor_LXXXVII._159"><span class="label">[LXXXVII.]</span></a> He was one of
the best bowlers
of his time in
England. He
playd at cards
rarely well, and
did use to
practise by
himselfe a bed,
and there
studyed how the
best way of
managing the
cards could be.
His sisters
comeing to the
Peccadillo-bowling-green
crying for the
feare he should
loose all &lt;their&gt;
portions.</p></div>

<p>Sir William would say that he did not much care for
a lord's converse, for they were in those dayes damnably
proud and arrogant, and the French would say that 'My
lord d'Angleterre ...<a name="FNanchor_1021_1230" id="FNanchor_1021_1230"></a><a href="#Footnote_1021_1230" class="fnanchor">[1021]</a> comme un mastif-dog'; but now
the age is more refined, and much by the example of his
gracious majestie, who is the patterne of courtesie.</p>

<p>Anno Domini 163- there happened, unluckily, a difference
between Sir John Suckling and Sir John Digby
(brother to Sir Kenelme) about a mistresse or gameing,
I have now forgott. Sir John was but a slight timberd
man, and of midling stature; Sir John Digby a proper
person of great strength, and courage answerable, and
yielded to be the best swordman of his time. Sir John,
with some 2 or 3 of his party assaults Sir John Digby goeing
into a play-house; Sir J. D. had only his lacquey with
him, but he<a name="FNanchor_1022_1231" id="FNanchor_1022_1231"></a><a href="#Footnote_1022_1231" class="fnanchor">[1022]</a> flew on them like a tigre, and made them run.
'Twas pitty that this accident brought the blemish of
cowardise to such an ingeniose young sparke. Sir J. D.
was such a hero that there were very few but he would
have served in the like manner.</p>

<p>Anno Domini 163- when the expedition was into
Scotland, Sir John Suckling, at his owne chardge, raysed
a troope of 100 very handsome young proper men, whom
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>he clad in white doubletts and scarlett breeches, and
scarlet coates, hatts, and ... feathers, well horsed, and
armed. They say 'twas one of the finest sights in those
dayes. But Sir John Menis made a lampoon<a name="FNanchor_BV_161" id="FNanchor_BV_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_BV_161" class="fnanchor">[BV]</a> of it
(vide the old collection of lampoons):</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'The ladies opened the windows to see<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So fine and goodly a sight-a,' &amp;c.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>I thinke the lampoon sayes he made an inglorious
chardge against the Scotts.</p>

<p>Quaere in what army he was in the Civill Warres.</p>

<p><a name="FNanchor_1023_1232" id="FNanchor_1023_1232"></a><a href="#Footnote_1023_1232" class="fnanchor">[1023]</a>Anno ... he went into France, where after some
time being come to the bottome of his fund that was left,
reflecting on the miserable and despicable condition he
should be reduced to, having nothing left to maintaine
him, he (having a convenience for that purpose, lyeing at
an apothecarie's house, in Paris) tooke poyson, which killed
him miserably with vomiting. He was buryed in the Protestants
church-yard. This was (to the best of my remembrance)
1646.</p>

<p>His picture, which is like him, before his Poems, says
that he was but 28 yeares old when he dyed.</p>

<p>He was of middle stature and slight strength, brisque
round eie, reddish fac't and red nose (ill liver), his head
not very big, his hayre a kind of sand colour; his beard
turnd-up naturally, so that he had brisk and gracefull
looke. He died a batchelour.</p>

<p>Memorandum:&mdash;he made a magnificent entertainment
in London, at ..., for a great number of ladies of
quality, all beauties and young, which cost him ...
hundreds of poundes, where were all the rarities that this
part of the world could afford, and the last service of all
was silke stockings and garters, and I thinke also gloves.</p>

<p>Anno Domini 1637 Sir John Suckling, William Davenant,
poet laureat (not then knighted), and Jack Young came
to the Bathe. Sir John came like a young prince for all
manner of equipage and convenience, and Sir W. Davenant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
told me that he had a cart-load of bookes carried downe,
and 'twas there, at Bath, that he writt the little tract in his
booke about Socinianism. 'Twas as pleasant a journey
as ever men had; in the heighth of a long peace and
luxury, and in the venison season. The second night they
lay at Marlborough, and walking on the delicate fine downes
at the backside of the towne, whilest supper was making
ready, the maydes were drying of cloathes on the bushes.
Jack Young had espied a very pretty young girle, and had
gott her consent for an assignation, which was about midnight,
which they happened to overheare on the other
side of the hedge, and were resolved to frustrate his
designe. They were wont every night to play at cards
after supper a good while; but Jack Young pretended
wearinesse, etc. and must needes goe to bed, not to be
perswaded by any meanes to the contrary. They had
their landlady at supper with them; said they to her,
'Observe this poor gentleman how he yawnes, now is his
mad fit comeing uppon him. We beseech you that you
make fast his dores, and gett somebody to watch and looke
to him, for about midnight he will fall to be most outragious:
gett the hostler, or some strong fellow, to stay-up, and we
will well content him, for he is our worthy friend, and a very
honest gentleman, only, perhaps, twice in a yeare he falls
into these fitts.' Jack Young slept not, but was ready
to goe out as the clock struck to the houre of appointment,
and then goeing to open the dore he was disappointed,
knocks, bounces, stampes, calls, 'Tapster! Chamberlayne!
Hostler!' sweares and curses dreadfully; nobody would
come to him. Sir John and W. Davenant were expectant
all this time, and ready to dye with laughter. I know not
how he happened to gett-open the dore, and was comeing
downe stayres. The hostler, a huge lusty fellow, fell upon
him, and held him, and cryed, 'Good sir, take God in your
mind, you shall not goe out to destroy your selfe.' J. Young
struggled and strived, insomuch that at last he was quite
spent and dispirited, and faine to goe to bed to rest
himselfe. In the morning the landlady of the house<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
came to see how he did, and brought him a cawdle. 'Oh
sir,' sayd she, 'you had a heavy fitt last night, pray, sir,
be pleased to take some of this to comfort your heart.'
Jack Young thought the woman had been mad, and being
exceedingly vexed, flirted the porrenger of cawdle in her
face. The next day his camerades told him all the plott,
how they crosse-bitt him. That night they went to
Bronham-house, Sir Edward Baynton's (then a noble seat,
since burnt in the civill warres), where they were nobly
entertained severall dayes. From thence, they went to West
Kington, to parson ... Davenant, Sir William's eldest
brother, where they stayd a weeke&mdash;mirth, witt, and good
cheer flowing. From thence to Bath, six or seven miles.</p>

<p>Memorandum:&mdash;parson Robert Davenant haz told me
that that tract about Socinianisme was writt on the table
in the parlour of the parsonage at West Kington.</p>

<p><a name="FNanchor_1024_1233" id="FNanchor_1024_1233"></a><a href="#Footnote_1024_1233" class="fnanchor">[1024]</a>My lady Southcot, whose husband hanged himselfe,
was Sir John Suckling's sister, to whom he writes a consolatory
letter, viz. the first. She afterwards maried ...
Corbet, D.D., of Merton Coll. Oxon<a name="FNanchor_BW_162" id="FNanchor_BW_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_BW_162" class="fnanchor">[BW]</a>. At her house in
Bishop's Gate-street, London, is an originall of her brother,
Sir John, of Sir Anthony van-Dyke, all at length, leaning
against a rock, with a play<a name="FNanchor_1025_1234" id="FNanchor_1025_1234"></a><a href="#Footnote_1025_1234" class="fnanchor">[1025]</a>-booke, contemplating. It is
a piece of great value. There is also another rare picture,
viz. of that pretty creature, Mris Jane Shore, an originall.</p>

<p>When his <i>Aglaura</i> was &lt;acted&gt;, he bought all the cloathes
himselfe, which were very rich; no tinsill, all the lace pure
gold and silver, which cost him ... I have now forgott.
He had some scaenes to it, which in those dayes were only
used at masques.</p>

<p>Memorandum:&mdash;Mr. Snowdon tells me, that after Sir
John's unluckie rencounter, or quarrell, with Sir John
Digby, wherin he was baffled: 'twas strange to see the
envie and ill nature of people to trample, and scoffe at,
and deject one in disgrace; inhumane as well as un-christian.
The lady ... Moray (quaere) had made an entertainment
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>for severall persons of quality at Ashley (in Surrey, near
Chertsey), whereat Mr. Snowdon then was. There was
the countesse of Middlesex, whom Sir John had highly
courted, and had spent on her, and in treating her, some
thousand of pounds. At this entertainment she could
not forbeare, but was so severe and ingrate as to upbraid
Sir John of his late recieved baffle; and some other ladys
had their flirts. The lady Moray (who invited them)
seing Sir John out of countenance, for whose worth she
alwaies had a respect: 'Well<a name="FNanchor_1026_1235" id="FNanchor_1026_1235"></a><a href="#Footnote_1026_1235" class="fnanchor">[1026]</a>,' sayd shee, 'I am a merry
wench, and will never forsake an old friend in disgrace,
so &lt;co&gt;me sitt downe by me, Sir John' (said she), and
seated him on her right hand, and countenanced him.
This raysed Sir John's dejected spirites that he threw
his reparties about the table with so much sparklingness
and gentilenes of witt, to the admiration of them all.</p>

<p><a name="FNanchor_1027_1236" id="FNanchor_1027_1236"></a><a href="#Footnote_1027_1236" class="fnanchor">[1027]</a>Sir John Suckling&mdash;from Mr. William Beeston&mdash;invented
the game of cribbidge. He sent his cards to
all gameing places in the country, which were marked
with private markes of his: he gott 20,000 <i>li.</i> by this way.
Sir Francis Cornwallis made <i>Aglaura</i>, except the end.</p>

fellowe, and there was a very rich brewer who brewed
to the navy, etc., who was ancient and he had maried
a young buxome wife.... The old brewer doted on his
desirable wife and dies and left her all his estate which

did it I have now forgot; but he was much upon mortgages,
and fed severall with hopes of being his heire.</p>

<p>'Twas from him that B. Johnson tooke his hint of the
fox, and by Seigneur Volpone is meant Sutton.</p>

<p>The later end of his dayes he lived in Fleetstreet at
a wollendraper's shop opposite to Fetterlane, where he
had so many great chests full of money that his chamber
was ready to groane under it; and Mr. Tyndale, who
knew him and I thinke had money of him on mortgage
during his lawe-suite (vide the lord Stafford's case in
Coke's Reports), was afrayd the roome would fall. He
lived to establish his hospitall, and was governor there
himselfe. Obiit....</p>

<p>The earle of Dorset (I thinke, Richard) mightily courted
him and presented<a name="FNanchor_1033_1242" id="FNanchor_1033_1242"></a><a href="#Footnote_1033_1242" class="fnanchor">[1033]</a> him, hoping to have been his heire;

cavalier of his time. He was the eldest son of the right
honourable Sir Henry Sydney, knight of the noble order of
the Garter, Lord President of Wales, and Lord Deputie of
Ireland, 1570. I suppose he was borne at Penshurst in
Kent (neer Tunbridge); vide.</p>

<p>He had the best tutors provided for him by his father
that could then be had, as ... Vide my Grammar<a name="FNanchor_BY_165" id="FNanchor_BY_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_BY_165" class="fnanchor">[BY]</a>

<p>He travelled France, Italie, Germany; he was in the
Poland warres, and at that time he had to his
page<a name="FNanchor_LXXXVIII._163" id="FNanchor_LXXXVIII._163"></a><a href="#Footnote_LXXXVIII._163" class="fnanchor">[LXXXVIII.]</a> (and as an excellent accomplishment)
Henry Danvers (afterwards earle of Danby),
then second son of Sir John Danvers of
Dantesey in Wilts, who accounted himselfe happy that his
son was so bestowed. He makes mention, in his Art of
Poesie, of his being in Hungarie (I remember).</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_LXXXVIII._163" id="Footnote_LXXXVIII._163"></a><a href="#FNanchor_LXXXVIII._163"><span class="label">[LXXXVIII.]</span></a> This my
cosen Elizabeth
Danvers, now
viscountesse
Purbec, his
niece, has told.</p></div>

<p>He was not only of an excellent witt, but extremely
beautifull; he much resembled his sister, but his haire was
not red, but a little inclining, viz. a darke amber colour. If
I were to find a fault in it, methinkes 'tis not masculine
enough; yett he was a person of great courage. He was
much at Wilton with his sister, and at Ivy-church<a name="FNanchor_1039_1248" id="FNanchor_1039_1248"></a><a href="#Footnote_1039_1248" class="fnanchor">[1039]</a> (which
adjoyns to the parke pale of Clarindon Parke), situated on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>a hill that overlookes all the country westwards, and north
over Sarum and the plaines, and into that delicious parke
(which was accounted the best of England) eastwards.
It was heretofore a monastery (the cloysters remayne
still); 'twas called coenobium Edrosium. My great uncle,
Mr. Thomas Browne, remembred him; and sayd that he was
often wont, as he was hunting on our pleasant plaines, to
take his table booke out of his pocket, and write downe his
notions as they came into his head, when he was writing
his Arcadia, (which was never finished by him).</p>

<p>He was the reviver of poetry in those darke times,
which was then at a very low ebbe,&mdash;e.g. 'The Pleasant
Comoedie of Jacob and Esau,' acted before King Henry
VIII's grace (where, I remember, is this expression, that
<i>the pottage was so good, that God Almighty might have putt
his finger in't</i>); 'Grammar Gurton's Needle'; and in these
playes there is not 3 lines but there is 'by God,' or 'by
God's wounds.'</p>

<p>He was of a very munificent spirit, and liberall to all
lovers of learning, and to those that pretended to any
acquaintance with Parnassus; in so much that he was
cloyd and surfeited with the poetasters of those dayes.
Among others<a name="FNanchor_1040_1249" id="FNanchor_1040_1249"></a><a href="#Footnote_1040_1249" class="fnanchor">[1040]</a> Mr. Edmund Spencer<a name="FNanchor_1041_1250" id="FNanchor_1041_1250"></a><a href="#Footnote_1041_1250" class="fnanchor">[1041]</a> made his addresse
to him, and brought his <i>Faery Queen</i>. Sir Philip was busy
at his study, and his servant delivered<a name="FNanchor_1042_1251" id="FNanchor_1042_1251"></a><a href="#Footnote_1042_1251" class="fnanchor">[1042]</a> Mr. Spencer's booke
to his master, who layd it by, thinking it might be such kind
of stuffe as he was frequently troubled with. Mr. Spencer
stayd so long that his patience was wearied, and went his
way discontented, and never intended to come again.
When Sir Philip perused it, he was so exceedingly delighted
with it, that he was extremely sorry he was gonne, and
where to send for him he knew not. After much enquiry
he learned his lodgeing, and sent for him, mightily caressed
&lt;him&gt;, and ordered his servant to give him ... pounds in
gold. His servant sayd that that was too much; 'No,'
said Sir Philip, 'he is ...,' and ordered an addition.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span></p>

<p>From this time there was a great friendship between them,
to his dying day.</p>

<p>I have heard Dr. Pell say, that he haz been told by
ancient gentlemen of those dayes of Sir Philip, so famous
for men at armes, that 'twas then held as great a disgrace
for a young gentleman<a name="FNanchor_1043_1252" id="FNanchor_1043_1252"></a><a href="#Footnote_1043_1252" class="fnanchor">[1043]</a> to be seen riding in the street in
a coach, as it would now for such a one to be seen in the
streetes in a petticoate and wastcoate; so much is the
fashion of the times nowe altered.</p>

<p>He maried the daughter of Sir Francis Walsingham,
Principall Secretary of Estate (I thinke his only child&mdash;quaere),
whom he loved very well....</p>

<p>Having recieved some shott or wound in the warres in
the Lowe-countreys, where he had command of ... (the
Ramikins, I thinke), he &lt;acted&gt; contrary to the injunction
of his physitians and chirurgions, which cost him his life:
upon which occasion there were some roguish verses made.</p>

<p>His body was putt in a leaden coffin (which, after the
firing of Paule's, I myselfe sawe), and with wonderfull
greate state was carried from ... to St. Paule's church,
where he was buried in our Ladie's Chapell: vide Sir
William Dugdale's <i>Paul's</i>, and epitaph. There solempnized
this funerall all the nobility and great officers of Court; all
the Judges and Serjeants at Lawe; all the soldiers, and
commanders, and gentry that were in London; the Lord
Mayer, and Aldermen, and Livery-men. His body was
borne on men's shoulders (perhaps 'twas a false coffin).</p>

<p>When I was a boy 9 yeares old, I was with my father at
one Mr. Singleton's, an alderman and wollen-draper in
Glocester, who had in his parlour, over the chimney, the
whole description of the funerall, engraved and printed on
papers pasted<a name="FNanchor_1044_1253" id="FNanchor_1044_1253"></a><a href="#Footnote_1044_1253" class="fnanchor">[1044]</a> together, which, at length, was, I beleeve,
the length of the room at least; but he had contrived it to
be turned upon two pinnes, that turning one of them made
the figures march all in order. It did make such a strong
impression on my young<a name="FNanchor_1045_1254" id="FNanchor_1045_1254"></a><a href="#Footnote_1045_1254" class="fnanchor">[1045]</a> phantasy, that I remember it as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>if it were but yesterday. I could never see it elswhere.
The house is in the great long street, over against<a name="FNanchor_1046_1255" id="FNanchor_1046_1255"></a><a href="#Footnote_1046_1255" class="fnanchor">[1046]</a> the
high steeple; and 'tis likely it remaines there still. 'Tis
pitty it is not re-donne.</p>

<p>In St. Mary's church at Warwick is a sumptuose monument
of the lord Brooke, round a great altar of black marble
is only this inscription:&mdash;</p>

<p>
Sir,<br />
</p>

<p>All the good bodies thanke you for your remembrance,
which I ought to have told you sooner if a paine in my
head had not hinderd me.</p>

<p>I wishe I could give you the key you desire, but all
I know of it is not worth anything; though conversant
amongst his relations, could learne noe more then Pamela's
being my lady Northumberland<a name="FNanchor_1049_1258" id="FNanchor_1049_1258"></a><a href="#Footnote_1049_1258" class="fnanchor">[1049]</a>, Philo[clea] my lady
Rich<a name="FNanchor_1050_1259" id="FNanchor_1050_1259"></a><a href="#Footnote_1050_1259" class="fnanchor">[1050]</a>, two sisters, the last beloved by him, upon whose
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>account he made his <i>Astrophell and Stella</i>; Miso, lady
Cox, Mopse, lady Lucy, persons altogether unknowne
now; Musid[orus] and Pericles, the two ladies' husbands.
Lord Ri[ch] being then his friend, he perswaded her
mother to the match, though he repented afterwards: she
then very young and secretly in love with him but he no
consern for her. Her beauty augmenting, he sayes in his
<i>Astrophel and Stella</i>, he didnt think 'the morn would have
proved soe faire a daye.' Their mother<a name="FNanchor_1051_1260" id="FNanchor_1051_1260"></a><a href="#Footnote_1051_1260" class="fnanchor">[1051]</a> was beautifull
and gallant (whether he meant Ginesia by her or noe,
I know not); but their father died, they being young. She
remaried to Dudley, Leycester and Northumberland, and
afterwards to her gentleman of the horse, Sir Cristopher
Blunt, which was beheaded with lord Essex. It was
thought he meant himself by Amphi[alus] and his lady,
Sir Francis Walsingham's daughter and heire, the queen
of Corinth. If he did make his owne character high, they
sayd Philisides was himself to, but it was all a guesse. He
made it young, and diyng desired his folies might be
burnt.</p>

<p>Some others I have heard guessed at, but have forgot.
Therfore canot satisfie the lady, which I would for your
sake.</p>

<p>I give you thankes but shall not want my grandmother's
epitaph (which was for a relation of ours heere, who
desird it), having found it of your giving.</p>

<p>I knew of my brother's place, but know nothing of his
mariyng yett.</p>

<p>My service to your brother. I am sorry all thinges
should not answear both your desires.</p>

<p>You have perfectly the good wishes of,</p>

<p><a name="FNanchor_1057_1266" id="FNanchor_1057_1266"></a><a href="#Footnote_1057_1266" class="fnanchor">[1057]</a>John Tayler, the water-poet:&mdash;his Workes are a fair
folio, printed, London, 1630.</p>

<p>&lt;He&gt; was borne in the citie of Glocester:&mdash;.... Tayler,
a painter, was his brother<a name="FNanchor_1058_1267" id="FNanchor_1058_1267"></a><a href="#Footnote_1058_1267" class="fnanchor">[1058]</a>, who told me thus 23 yeares
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>since (he lives yet at Oxon): and his picture hung in the
Schooles gallery.</p>

<p>He came to London and bound himselfe to a water-man,
in which capacity he wrote his poems. I have heard
Josias Howe, M.A., say that he will choose out 6 verses
(quaere) there as good as you will find in any other.</p>

<p>He was very facetious and diverting company; and for
stories and lively telling them, few could out-doe him.</p>

<p>Anno 1643, at the Act time, I sawe him at Oxon.
I guesse he was then neer 50. I remember he was of
middle stature, had a good quick looke, a black velvet,
a plush-gippe and silver shoulder-belt; was much made of
by the scholars, and was often with Josias Howe at
Trinity College.</p>

<p>He had heretofore in the long peace severall figgaries,
e.g. he came from London to Salisbury in his skuller.
He went so to Calais. He went to Scotland (I think
round Great Britaine) <i>littus legens</i> in his skuller.</p>

<p>Ever since the begining of the civill warres he lived in
Turne-stile-alley in Long Acre, about<a name="FNanchor_1059_1268" id="FNanchor_1059_1268"></a><a href="#Footnote_1059_1268" class="fnanchor">[1059]</a> the middle on the

His conversation was incomparable for three or four
mornings' draughts. But afterwards you were entertained
with <i>crambe bis cocta</i>. His signe was his owne head, and
very like him, which about 22 yeares since was removed to
the alehowse, the corner howse opposite to Clarendon
howse. Under his picture are these verses; on one side:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">

<span class="i0">There's many a head stands for a signe.<br /></span>

and had, in those times, great power, which
power he used civilly and obligeingly, that he was beloved
by all the King's party.</p>

<p>He was very musicall, and hath composed many things,
and I have heard anthemes of his sang before his majestie,
in his chapell, and the king told him he liked them. He
had a very fine chamber organ in those unmusicall dayes.
There was a great friendship between Matthew Lock, since
organist of the Queen's chapell, and him<a name="FNanchor_LXXXIX._167" id="FNanchor_LXXXIX._167"></a><a href="#Footnote_LXXXIX._167" class="fnanchor">[LXXXIX.]</a>.</p>

maryed Mr.
Garnon's
daughter, in

<p>His father left him a pretty good estate, but
he bought church lands and had the moeity of
the bishop's palace, at Hereford, where he layd
out much money in building and altering. Col. John
Burch<a name="FNanchor_1064_1273" id="FNanchor_1064_1273"></a><a href="#Footnote_1064_1273" class="fnanchor">[1064]</a> had the other moeity.</p>

<p>The times turning, he was faine to disgorge all he had
gott, and was ruined, but Sir Paul Neile got for him the
keeper of the King's stores at Harwich, worth about <span class="smcap">C</span><i>li.</i>
per annum.</p>

<p>He was a great lover of antiquities, and ransackt the
MSS. of the Church of Hereford (there were a great many
that lay uncouth and unkiss).</p>

<p>He also garbled the library of the church of Worcester,
and evidences, where he had the originall grant of King
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>Edgar (&#952;&#945;&#955;&#945;&#963;&#963;&#953;&#945;&#961;&#967;&#951;&#962;) whence the Kings of England derive
their right to the soveraignty of the sea. 'Tis printed in
Mr. Selden's <i>Mare Clausum</i>. I have seen it many times,
and it is as legible as but lately written (Roman character).
He offered it to the king for 120<i>li.</i> but his majesty would
not give so much. Since his death, I acquainted the
Secretary of Estate that he dyed in debt, and his creditors
seised on his goods and papers. He told me that it did of
right belong to Worcester Church. I told one of their
prebends, and they cared not for such things. I beleeve it
haz wrapt herings by this time.</p>

<p>He had severall MSS. by him of great antiquity: one
thin 4to. of the Philosopher's Stone, in Hieroglyphicks,
with some few Latin verses underneath; the most curiously
limned that ever I sawe. His Majesty offered him 100<i>li.</i>
for it, and he would not accept it. Tell Dr. Crowder<a name="FNanchor_1065_1274" id="FNanchor_1065_1274"></a><a href="#Footnote_1065_1274" class="fnanchor">[1065]</a> of

have his remembrance in esteeme: and tho' he dyed above
100<i>li.</i> in their debt, yet the towne lost not by him, for the
reason aforesaid.</p>

<p>The history or collection of this ancient borough he
pawned a little before his death to Mr. Baker, the printseller
by the Old Exchange, for 4<i>li.</i> 15<i>s.</i> I acquainted
Sir Philip Parker, whom the borough uses to choose for
their burghesse, to buy it for his borough. He would
not lay out so much money, which would doe them
more service then all his roast-beefe, wine, and ale at
an election.</p>

<h3><b>John Tombes</b> (1603-1676).</h3>


<p><a name="FNanchor_1080_1289" id="FNanchor_1080_1289"></a><a href="#Footnote_1080_1289" class="fnanchor">[1080]</a>Mr. John Tombs, B.D. (quaere A. Wood's <i>Antiq. Oxon.</i>)
was borne at Beaudley in Worcestershire; his father was a....</p>

<p>Anno Domini &lt;1617/8&gt; he was admitted at Magdalen-hall,
in Oxon. Anno &lt;1621&gt;, A.B.; Anno &lt;1624&gt;, A.M. He
read to pupills, and was tutor there to John Wilkins, afterwards
bishop of Chester. He was a great master of the
Greeke tongue, and the Hebrue he understood well. He
alwaies carried a little Greeke Testament about with him;
he had &lt;it&gt; almost memoriter. He was an admirable disputant;
I remember he was wont to say, that to be a good
disputant, 'tis requisite for one to be a good grammarian,
as well as logician. I have forgott if he was pupill to the
learned Mr. &lt;William&gt; Pemble; but his favourite he was.
He was soon taken notice of for his curious searching,
piercing witt: he preached somewhere eastwards from
Oxon, and had a company<a name="FNanchor_1081_1290" id="FNanchor_1081_1290"></a><a href="#Footnote_1081_1290" class="fnanchor">[1081]</a> followed him; and 'twas
predicted he would doe a great deale of mischiefe to
the Church of England, reflecting upon what ... sayes,
that the greatest witts have donne the most mischiefe
to the Church, introducing new opinions, etc. Anno ...
he was vicar of a market-towne<a name="FNanchor_1082_1291" id="FNanchor_1082_1291"></a><a href="#Footnote_1082_1291" class="fnanchor">[1082]</a> in Herefordshire,
where he was very well beloved by his parish, and Sir ...
Croftes, eldest brother to the now bishop of Hereford,
built a house in Leominster, to live there, to heare him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>preach. Anno ... he writt ..., 8vo, dedicated to John
Scudamore, viscount Slego, baron of ... drum<a name="FNanchor_1083_1292" id="FNanchor_1083_1292"></a><a href="#Footnote_1083_1292" class="fnanchor">[1083]</a>. Anno
1645, 1646, he was master of the Temple at London,
i.e. minister. In 1647 he was supplanted there by parson
Johnson. Then he went into his owne country, to Beaudley
(a market-towne), at which time Mr. Baxter (his antagonist)
preacht at Kitterminster, the next market-towne, two miles
distant. They preacht against one another's doctrines, and
printed against each other. Mr. Tombes was the Coryph&aelig;us
of the Anabaptists: both had great<a name="FNanchor_1084_1293" id="FNanchor_1084_1293"></a><a href="#Footnote_1084_1293" class="fnanchor">[1084]</a> audience;
they went severall miles on foot to each doctor. Once
(I thinke oftner), they disputed face to face, anno ...;
and the followers were like two armies, about 1500 of
a party; and truly, at last they fell by the eares, hurt was
donne, and the civill magistrate had much adoe to quiet
them. About anno 1664 he came to the Act at Oxford
(quaere), and did there <i>in vesperiis</i> sett up a challenge to
maintaine <i>contra omnes gentes</i> the Anabaptisticall doctrine;
but not a man would grapple with him. Now, though
<i>prim&acirc; facie</i> this might seeme very bold to challenge a whole
University, 'twas not so very strange neither, for he came
throughly prepared, after 30 yeares' study and thoughts,
and most of them surprised.</p>

<p><i>Scripsit</i>....</p>

<p>Dr. &lt;Robert&gt; Sanderson, lord bishop of Lincolne, and
he, had a greate esteeme for each other, so also had
Dr. &lt;Thomas&gt; Barlowe (now bishop there). Putting aside his
Anabaptisticall positions, he was comformable enough to the
Church of England. About 1658 or 9, he maried the
widowe of ... Dove, of Salisbury, and went to hear the
Common Prayer there, and recieved the Sacraments; and
sometimes wayted on bishop Ward, who respected him for
his learning. He was thought to be as great a divine as
most we had after bishop Sanderson dyed. I remember he
never, or seldome, was wont to say Our Saviour Christ, but
<i>My Lord Christ</i>. He seemed to be a very pious and zealous
Christian. I have heard him say (though he was much
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>opposite to the Romish religion) that truly, for his part,
should he see a poor zealous friar goeing to preach, he should
pay<a name="FNanchor_1085_1294" id="FNanchor_1085_1294"></a><a href="#Footnote_1085_1294" class="fnanchor">[1085]</a> him respect. He was but a little man, neat limbed,
a little quick searching eie, sad, gray. He dyed at Salisbury,
May 22, and was buried 25th, in St. Edmund's church-yard,
anno Domini 1676, opposite to the steeple, a good
distance on the north side. His daughter dyed 7 yeares
before him, and haz a grave-stone on her, with an inscription.
He lyes there, and in the same stone is since engraven
an inscription to the purpose already written of Mr. John
Tombes.</p>

between Bautre and Doncaster.</p>

<p>Obiit ... Decemb., sepultus 23 Decemb. &lt;1680&gt; in the
vault of the church-yard of St. Mary Stayning, London;
where, before the conflagration, was a church, of which he
was the parson<a name="FNanchor_1089_1298" id="FNanchor_1089_1298"></a><a href="#Footnote_1089_1298" class="fnanchor">[1089]</a>; but I have heard his brother, captain
Tong (of the King's Guards) say 'twas worth but 18 <i>li.</i> per
annum, for he had gathered it.</p>

<p>Mr. &lt;Thomas&gt; Jones (who preached his funerall sermon:
printed) sayes that he haz left two tomes in folio of alchymie.
His excellency lay <i>there</i>.</p>

<p>About 1658, or 1659, the then-Power made an Academie
of the Bishop's Pallace at Durham, for the benefit of the
North. Dr. Tonge was the governour, or one of the professors.
Ned Bagshawe was proposed to have been another.
The Dr. had an excellent schoole there, and followed precisely
the Jesuites' method of teaching; and boyes did profit
wonderfully, as needes they must, by that method.</p>

<p>He afterwards taught at Islington, at Sir Thomas Fisher's

printed heads of Caesars, &amp;c.; verbes under such a head,
governed a dative case; under another, an ablative. The
boyes had it as readie as could be. I have been there.</p>

the way of teaching children to write a good hand in
twenty dayes' time, by writing over, with black inke, copies
printed from copper-plates in red inke:&mdash;viz., the children
(scilicet, about 8 or 9 aetatis) were to do it four howers in
the day; i.e. 2 howers or 2 halfe-howers in the morning
at a time (as the boyes' temper could endure it, without
tyring him); and then to play as long; and then to it
again, to keep up the idea in the child fresh. Since his
death, Mr. Robert Moray (projector<a name="FNanchor_1093_1302" id="FNanchor_1093_1302"></a><a href="#Footnote_1093_1302" class="fnanchor">[1093]</a> of the Penney Post)

<p>His funerall sermon was preached in the church of
St. Michael, Wood-street; the church of St. Mary Stayning
being burn't, and never to be re-edified, but both parishes

(when the king was beheaded); afterwards at Hayes,
Surrey, 12 miles from London. 'Twas here our<a name="FNanchor_1103_1312" id="FNanchor_1103_1312"></a><a href="#Footnote_1103_1312" class="fnanchor">[1103]</a> common
friend George Ent went to schoole to him, who told me
that he had forgot the smart of his old master, Gill; he
was very severe.</p>

<p>I'le tell you a story of our old friend. His master
Triplett was a great lover of honey, and one of his schoolefellow's
mother having sent a pott of honey to the doctor,
G. Ent putt his schoolefellow to beg a little of his master,
and he had gott a manchet and so they would have
a <i>regalio</i>. The doctor was in his study; and the boy takes
the confidence to approach, with his 'Quaeso, praeceptor,
da mihi mel.' G. Ent was sneaking behind. Q<sup>d</sup>. the
disturbed doctor, 'You audacious raskall,' and gave him
a good cuffe on the ear, 'how dare you be thus impudent?
Sirrah, who putt you on?' The boy answered (whiningly)
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>'G. Ent.' The enraged doctor flies out of his study (he
was a very strong man), gives poore George a kick in the
breech, and made him fly downe a flight of 7 or 8 staires
to the landing-place, where his head first came to. He
was stunn'd, but 'twas well his neck was not broken.
'Twas a most cruel and inhumane act to use a poore child
so. It so happened that a day or two before G. E. had
shaled a tooth. He writes a letter to his father (now Sir
George Ent) and incloses the tooth in it; relates the story
and that he lost the tooth by that meanes<a name="FNanchor_1104_1313" id="FNanchor_1104_1313"></a><a href="#Footnote_1104_1313" class="fnanchor">[1104]</a>. The next
day the grave and learned Dr. Ent comes to Hayes (the
fame of whose learning and testimonie did give great credit
and reputation to this schoole); expostulates with the
doctor about his sonne. To be short, tooke him away, and
placed him with Mr. William Radford at Richmond (an
honest sequestred fellow of Trinity College, Oxon, and
an excellent schoolmaster, having been bred at Thame
under Dr. Birt<a name="FNanchor_1105_1314" id="FNanchor_1105_1314"></a><a href="#Footnote_1105_1314" class="fnanchor">[1105]</a> and afterwards sent to Winton.) This
accident well-nigh did breake Dr. Triplett's schoole. But
shortly after this time, happened the restauration of his
majestie, and then he was also restored to his former
preferments.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&lt;In MS. Aubr. 21, among the notes Aubrey has jotted down for his
projected comedy <i>The Country Revel</i>, are a number under the initials
of T. T., i.e. of Thomas Tyndale (see p. <a href="#Page_190">190</a>, <i>supra</i>), whom Aubrey
took for his model in depicting an old gentleman ('Sir Eubule Nestor')
of the heroic age. Some of these opinions of 'an old courtier of the
Queen's' are collected here.&gt;</p></div>

<p>In those days (Elizabetha regina) the great men had
a gate (the yettes), and when a senator went to the
Parliament-house a-foote, or a horse-back with his foot-cloath,
he had at his heeles 1/2 a dozen or 10 tall fellowes with
blew coates and badges and long basket-hilt swords. Now
forsooth only a laquey and a little spitt-pig<a name="FNanchor_1110_1319" id="FNanchor_1110_1319"></a><a href="#Footnote_1110_1319" class="fnanchor">[1110]</a>.</p>

tho<a name="FNanchor_1111_1320" id="FNanchor_1111_1320"></a><a href="#Footnote_1111_1320" class="fnanchor">[1111]</a> kept good horses, and many horses for a man-at-armes,
and men that could ride them; hunting horses.
Now we are come all to our coaches forsooth! (Sir Philip
Sydney<a name="FNanchor_1112_1321" id="FNanchor_1112_1321"></a><a href="#Footnote_1112_1321" class="fnanchor">[1112]</a>). Now young men are so farre from managing
good horses, they know not how to ride a hunting nag nor
handle their weapons. So God help the king if, etc.</p>

<p>In Sir Philip Sydney's time 'twas as much disgrace for
a cavalier to be seen in London rideing in a coach in the
street as now 'twould be to be seen in a petticoate and
wastcoate. They rode in the streets then with their rich
footcloathes, and servants wayting on them with blewe
coates and badge, 6<a name="FNanchor_1113_1322" id="FNanchor_1113_1322"></a><a href="#Footnote_1113_1322" class="fnanchor">[1113]</a>, 8, 12 +.</p>

<p>T. T., an old gentleman that remembers Queen Elizabeth's
raigne and court, one of true gravity and prudence, not one
that depends upon the grave cutt of his beard to be thought
so. He hath seen much in his time both at home and
abroade; and with much choler inveighes against things
now:&mdash;'Alas! O' God's will! Now-a-dayes every one,
forsooth! must have coaches, forsooth! In those dayes
gentlemen kept horses for a man-at-armes, besides their
hackney and hunting horses. This made the gentry robust
and hardy and fitt for service; were able to be their owne
guides in case of a rout or so, when occasion should so
require<a name="FNanchor_1114_1323" id="FNanchor_1114_1323"></a><a href="#Footnote_1114_1323" class="fnanchor">[1114]</a>. Our gentry forsooth in these dayes are so
effeminated that they know not how to ride on horseback.&mdash;Tho
when the gentry mett, it was not at a poor blind
sordid alehouse, to drinke up a barrell of drinke and lie
drunke there two or three dayes together; fall together by
the eares. They mett tho in the fields, well-appointed, with
their hounds or their hawkes; kept up good hospitality;
and kept a good retinue, that would venture that bloud
and spirit that filled their vaines which their masters' tables
nourisht<a name="FNanchor_1115_1324" id="FNanchor_1115_1324"></a><a href="#Footnote_1115_1324" class="fnanchor">[1115]</a>; kept their tenants in due respect of them. We
had no depopulacion in those dayes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span></p>

<p>'You see in me the ruines of time. The day is almost at
end with me, and truly I am glad of it: I desire not to
live in this corrupt age. I foresawe and foretold the late
changes, and now easily foresee what will follow after.

was brought into England by his father, an eminent
merchant; lived 55 yeares in one house at St. Mary Hill,
and dyed in the 74th yeare of his age. He lived there till

and cry of the poore, he bade them bee
of good comfort for they should not starve,
for he would give them his labour and the
use of his estate for that yeare. He being a man of
vast credit, gave his factors order that what corne they
could buy at such and such rates beyond sea, to hire flye-boates
and send them over to the port of London, of which
he bought in one yeare two thousand five hundred sayle.
The corne that cost him 12<i>s.</i> per bushell beyond sea, he
sold here for 14<i>s.</i>; and some of the places from whence he
had corne (they selling it by reason of the greatnesse of
the price) afterwards wanted it themselves and were faine
to be supplied from hence, i.e. in some places, for which
they were faine to pay halfe value more then the first cost,
or els must have starved.</p>

(quaere) in the fair brick house, the farthest on the

schoole. I have heard Mr. Thomas Bigge, of Wickham,
say (who was his schoole-fellow, and of the same forme),
that he little thought then he would have been so rare
a poet; he was wont to make his exercise for him.</p>

<p>His paternall estate, and by his first wife, was 3000 <i>li.</i>
per annum. His first wife was ... (vide Heralds'
Office) of Worcestershire, by whom he had ... per

<p>... Waller (I thinke, Walter) was his
tutor at King's College, Cambridge, who was
a very learned man, and was afterwards vicar
of Broad Chalke, Wilts.</p>

<p>A burghesse in Parliament, for Beconsfield,
in king James's<a name="FNanchor_1149_1358" id="FNanchor_1149_1358"></a><a href="#Footnote_1149_1358" class="fnanchor">[1149]</a> time, and has been of all the Parliaments
since the restauration of king Charles II (1680,
aetat. 74 +).</p>

<p>One of the first refiners of our English language and
poetrey. When he was a brisque young sparke, and first
studyed poetry, 'Methought,' said he, 'I never sawe a good
copie of English verses; they want smoothnes; then
I began to essay.' I have severall times heard him say,
that he cannot versify when he will; but when the fitt
comes upon him, he does it easily, i.e. in plaine termes,
when his Mercurius and Venus are well aspected.</p>

<p>He told me he was not acquainted with Ben. Johnson
(who dyed about 1638), but familiarly with Lucius, lord
Falkland; Sydney Godolphin, Mr. Hobbes; &amp;c.</p>

<p>He was very much admired at Court before the late
civill warres. 164-, he being then a member of the House
of Commons, he was committed prisoner to the Tower, for
the plott, with &lt;Nathaniel&gt; Tomkins (his cosen-germane)<a name="FNanchor_1150_1359" id="FNanchor_1150_1359"></a><a href="#Footnote_1150_1359" class="fnanchor">[1150]</a>
and &lt;Richard&gt; Chaloner, for firing the City of London, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>delivering the Parliament, etc. to the King's partie: vide
Transactions of those times. He had much adoe then to
save his life, and in order to it, sold his estate in Bedfordshire,
about<a name="FNanchor_1151_1360" id="FNanchor_1151_1360"></a><a href="#Footnote_1151_1360" class="fnanchor">[1151]</a> 1300 <i>li.</i> per annum, to Dr. Wright, M.D. for
10,000 <i>li.</i>, (much under value) which was procured in 24
hours' time, or els he had been hanged (quaere E. Wyld, esq.).
With which money he bribed the whole House, which was
the first time a House of Commons was ever bribed. His
excellent rhetoricall speech to the House (vide his speech
to save his life), as also his panegyrique to Oliver, Lord
Protector, he would not suffer to be inserted in the edition
of his Poems since the restauration of king Charles II.</p>

<p>After he had obtayned his pardon of the Parliament, he
went to France, where he stayed ... yeares, and was
there very kindly recieved, and esteemed. Anno Domini ...
he returned into England.</p>

<p>When king Charles II returned, he recieved Mr. Waller
very kindly, and no man's conversation is more esteemed
at court now then his. The dutches of Yorke (daughter
to the duke of Modena) very much delights &lt;in&gt; his
company, and hath layed her commands on him to
write, which he hath dedicated to her highnes.</p>

<p>His intellectualls are very good yet<a name="FNanchor_1152_1361" id="FNanchor_1152_1361"></a><a href="#Footnote_1152_1361" class="fnanchor">[1152]</a> (1680), and makes
verses; but he growes feeble. He wrote verses of the
Bermudas 50 yeares since, upon the information of one
that had been there; walking in his fine woods, the poetique
spirit came upon him.</p>

<p>He is of somewhat above a middle stature, thin body,
not at all robust: fine thin skin, his face somewhat of an
olivaster; his hayre frizzd, of a brownish colour; full eye,
popping out and working: ovall faced, his forehead high
and full of wrinckles. His head but small, braine very
hott, and apt to be cholerique&mdash;<i>Quanto doctior, eo iracundior.</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Cicero</span>.
He is something magisteriall, and haz<a name="FNanchor_1153_1362" id="FNanchor_1153_1362"></a><a href="#Footnote_1153_1362" class="fnanchor">[1153]</a>
a great mastership of the English language. He is of
admirable and gracefull elocution, and exceeding ready.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span></p>

<p>He has spent most of his time in London, especially in
winter; but oftentimes in the summer he enjoyes his muse
at Beconsfield, which is incomparable aire, and where are
delicious walks in the woods. Now I speake of woods, I remember

<p><span class="smcap">A.D.</span> ... he was admitted a fellow of the Royall

<p>He haz but a tender weake body, but was alwayes very

he fell downe, and had a cruell fall. 'Twas pitty

witt and mastership in rhetorique, etc. he will oftentimes
be guilty of mispelling in English. He writes a lamentably
&lt;bad&gt; hand, as bad &lt;as&gt; the scratching of a hen.</p>

<p>I have heard him say that he so much admired
Mr. Thomas Hobbes' booke <i>De Cive</i>, when it came forth,
that he was very desirous to have it donne into English,
and Mr. Hobbes was most willing it should be done by
Mr. Waller's hand, for that he was so great a master of
our English language. Mr. Waller freely promised him
to doe it, but first he would desire Mr. Hobbes to make
an essaye; he (T. H.) did the first booke, and did it so
extremely well, that Mr. Waller would not meddle with
it<a name="FNanchor_1157_1366" id="FNanchor_1157_1366"></a><a href="#Footnote_1157_1366" class="fnanchor">[1157]</a>, for that nobody els could doe it so well. Had he
thought he could have better performed it, he would have
himselfe been the translator.</p>

is in his booke of Poems: his Panegyrique to Oliver the
Protector I have: and also to King Charles II.</p>

<p>He sayes that he was bred under severall ill, dull,
ignorant schoolmasters, till he went to Mr. Dobson, at ...
Wickham, who was a good schoolmaster, and had
been an Eaton scholar.</p>

<p>Memorandum:&mdash;later end of Aug. 1680, he wrote verses,
called 'Divine Love,' at the instance and request of the
lady viscountesse Ranulagh.</p>

<p>He missed<a name="FNanchor_1158_1367" id="FNanchor_1158_1367"></a><a href="#Footnote_1158_1367" class="fnanchor">[1158]</a> the Provostship of Eaton Colledge, &lt;Feb.&gt;

he had a very great desire to have bought again, not long
before his death, but the owner would not sell it: part of
the house haz been new-built, but the roome wherein he
was borne is yet standing. Said he, to his cousin Hamden,
<i>A stagge, when he is hunted, and neer spent, alwayes

false; but his brother was a foole, as to discourse or
businesse, but was very learned. And whereas Dr. &lt;Peter&gt;

<h3><b>John Wallis</b> (1616-1703).</h3>


<p><a name="FNanchor_1166_1375" id="FNanchor_1166_1375"></a><a href="#Footnote_1166_1375" class="fnanchor">[1166]</a>John Wallis, D.D.&mdash;I find at Lid in Kent that his
father was Mr. John Wallis, minister of Ashford, in Kent.</p>

<p><a name="FNanchor_1167_1376" id="FNanchor_1167_1376"></a><a href="#Footnote_1167_1376" class="fnanchor">[1167]</a>John Wallis<a name="FNanchor_CK_184" id="FNanchor_CK_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_CK_184" class="fnanchor">[CK]</a>, D.D., was borne at Ashford, in the
county of Kent, Anno Domini &lt;1616&gt;. His father was
minister there. He went to schoole there.</p>

<p>At ... yeares old he was admitted at Emanuel Colledge
in Cambridge; 'ubi fuit alumnus, deinde Collegii Reginalis
ibidem socius' (Mr. Oughtred's preface to his <i>Clavis</i>). Anno
&lt;1636/7&gt; A.B.; anno &lt;1640&gt; M.A. He was a good student,
but fell not to the study of the mathematiques till he was
above twenty.</p>

<p>A<a name="FNanchor_CL_185" id="FNanchor_CL_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_CL_185" class="fnanchor">[CL]</a> remarkable passage of his life, was, that he
was a witnesse of W. Laud's (archbishop of Canterbury)
tryall, for his introducing popish innovations into the
University of Cambridge: see <i>Canterbury's Doome</i>, printed
1646, pag. 73, and elswhere. The first remarqueable
passage of his life was his decyphering the letters of King
Charles I taken at the battle at Nasby, which booke is
called <i>The King's Cabinet Opened</i>, printed at London, ...
Anno ... was scolar to Mr. W. Oughtred.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span></p>

<p>Anno 164&lt;9&gt; after the Visitation by the Parliament, he
came to Oxon, and was made Savillian Professor of
Geometrie. ..., &lt;elected&gt; Fellow of the Royall Societie.
Great<a name="FNanchor_1168_1377" id="FNanchor_1168_1377"></a><a href="#Footnote_1168_1377" class="fnanchor">[1168]</a> contests between him and Mr. Thomas Hobbes, of
Malmesbury: sure their Mercuries are in &#9633;<a name="FNanchor_1169_1378" id="FNanchor_1169_1378"></a><a href="#Footnote_1169_1378" class="fnanchor">[1169]</a> or opposition.
Anno Domini 1657, he gott himselfe to be chosen by
unjust meanes<a name="FNanchor_XCV._183" id="FNanchor_XCV._183"></a><a href="#Footnote_XCV._183" class="fnanchor">[XCV.]</a> to be Custos Archivorum of the
University of Oxon, at which time Dr. &lt;Richard&gt;
Zouch had the majority of voyces, but because
Dr. Zouch was a malignant (as Dr. Wallis
openly protested, and that he had talked
against Oliver), he was putt aside. Now, for the Savillian
Professor to hold another place besides, is so downeright
against Sir Henry Savile's statutes, that nothing can be
imagined more; and if he does, he is downeright perjured.
Yet the Dr. is allowed to keepe the other place still.</p>

<div class="footnote">

Stubbes' (The
Savillian
Professour's
case stated:
Lond. 1658)
de hoc: who haz
told him of it.</p></div>

<p>Anno &lt;1654&gt; he tooke his degree of Doctor, at the Act,
at Oxon, and went out grand-compounder (which costes
200 <i>li.</i>), only that he might take place<a name="FNanchor_1170_1379" id="FNanchor_1170_1379"></a><a href="#Footnote_1170_1379" class="fnanchor">[1170]</a> of Dr. Seth Ward,
who was about a yeare his senior. In 1661 Dr. Ward was
made deane of Exon, and the next yeare bishop of the
same place; and so Dr. Wallis's 200 <i>li.</i> was meerly cast
away. The bishop protested he was troubled for the losse
of his brother Wallis's two hundred pounds.</p>

<p>He hath writt severall treatises, and well; and to give
him his due prayse, hath exceedingly well deserved of the
commonwealth of learning, perhaps no mathematicall
writer so much.</p>

<p>'Tis certaine that he is a person of reall worth, and may
stand<a name="FNanchor_CM_186" id="FNanchor_CM_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_CM_186" class="fnanchor">[CM]</a> with much glory upon his owne basis, needing not
&lt;to&gt; be beholding to any man for fame, of which he is
so extremely greedy, that he steales flowers from others
to adorne his owne cap,&mdash;e.g. he lies at watch, at
Sir Christopher<a name="FNanchor_1171_1380" id="FNanchor_1171_1380"></a><a href="#Footnote_1171_1380" class="fnanchor">[1171]</a> Wren's discourse, Mr. Robert Hooke's,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>his note booke, and then prints it, without owneing the
authors. This frequently, of which they complaine.</p>

<p>But though he does an injury to the inventors, he does
good to learning, in publishing such curious notions, which
the author (especially Sir Christopher Wren) might never
have the leisure to write of himselfe.</p>

<p>When Mr. Oughtred's <i>Clavis Mathematica</i> was printed at
Oxford (editio tertia, with additions), Mr. W. O.,<a name="FNanchor_1173_1382" id="FNanchor_1173_1382"></a><a href="#Footnote_1173_1382" class="fnanchor">[1173]</a> in his
preface, gives worthy characters of severall young mathematicians
that he enformed, and, amongst others, of John
Wallis, who would be so kind to Mr. Oughtred, as to take
the paines to correct the presse, which the old gentleman
doth with respect there thus acknowledge, after he hath
enumerated his titles and preferments; <i>viri ingenui, pii,
industrii, in omni reconditiore literatura versatissimi, in
rebus Mathematicis admodum perspicacis, et in enodatione
explicationeque scriptorum intricatissimis Zipherarum involucris
occultatorum (quod ingenii subtilissimi argumentum
est) ad miraculum foelicis</i>. This last, of the cyphers, was
added by Dr. Wallis himselfe; which when, the booke
being printed, the old gentleman sawe, he was much
vexed at it; and sayd, that he had thought he had given
him sufficient prayse, with which he might have rested<a name="FNanchor_1174_1383" id="FNanchor_1174_1383"></a><a href="#Footnote_1174_1383" class="fnanchor">[1174]</a>

<p>He maried ... and haz a good temporall estate in Kent....
He has only two daughters, handsome young gentle-woemen;
one maried to Mr. ... Blencowe, of Middleton-Cheyney,

<p>He lives at a well-built house, near New Colledge, in Oxon;
is a Justice of the Peace there, and has been 167-, 1679,
1680.</p>

a very honest repute.</p>

<p>At &lt;16&gt; yeares old he went to Sydney Colledge in Cambridge;
he was servitor<a name="FNanchor_XCVI._187" id="FNanchor_XCVI._187"></a><a href="#Footnote_XCVI._187" class="fnanchor">[XCVI.]</a> to Dr. &lt;Samuel&gt; Ward (Master of
the Colledge, and Professor of Divinity), who,
being much taken with his ingenuity and
industry, as also with his suavity of nature,
quickly made him scholar of the howse, and
after, fellowe. Though he was of his name, he was not
at all akinne to him (which most men imagined because of
the great kindnesse to him); but the consimility of their
dispositions was a greater tye of friendship then that of
blood, which signifies but little, as to that point.</p>

<h4>&lt;<i>Mathematical studies.</i>&gt;</h4>

<p>His father taught him common arithmetique, and his
genius lay much to the mathematiques, which being naturall
to him, he quickly and easily attained.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span></p>

<p>Sir Charles Scarborough, M.D. (then an ingeniose young
student, and fellowe&mdash;quaere&mdash;of Caius Colledge in Cambridge),
was his great acquaintance; both students in
mathematiques; which the better to perfect, they went to
Mr. Willam Oughtred, at Albury in Surrey, to be enformed
by him in his <i>Clavis Mathematica</i>, which was then a booke
of aenigmata. Mr. Oughtred treated them with exceeding
humanity, being pleased at his heart when an ingeniose
young man came to him that would ply his Algebra hard.
When they returned to Cambridge, they read the <i>Clavis
Mathematica</i> to their pupills, which was the first time that
that booke was ever read in a<a name="FNanchor_1179_1388" id="FNanchor_1179_1388"></a><a href="#Footnote_1179_1388" class="fnanchor">[1179]</a> university. Mr. Laurence
Rooke, a good mathematician and algebrist, (and I thinke
had also been Mr. Oughtred's disciple<a name="FNanchor_1180_1389" id="FNanchor_1180_1389"></a><a href="#Footnote_1180_1389" class="fnanchor">[1180]</a>) was his great
acquaintance. &#9758; Mr. Rooke (I remember) did read (and
that admirably well) on the sixth chapter of the <i>Clavis
Mathematica</i> in Gresham Colledge.</p>


<h4>&lt;<i>Ejected from Cambridge.</i>&gt;</h4>

<p>Anno Domini 164&lt;4&gt;, at the breaking out of the civill
warres, he was a prisoner, together with Dr. &lt;Samuel&gt;

gott out of prison, he was very civilly and kindly received
by his friend and neighbour, Ralph Freeman, of Apsten,
esq., a vertuous and hospitable gentleman, where he
continued....</p>

well acquainted and beloved in that colledge; by the consent

to him, and dyed some few dayes after<a name="FNanchor_CO_192" id="FNanchor_CO_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_CO_192" class="fnanchor">[CO]</a>. Anno 1660,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>degree of doctor in Divinity, at the Act, at Oxford, at the
same time with Dr. John Wallis.</p>


<h4>&lt;<i>Church preferment.</i>&gt;</h4>

<p>He then enjoyed his chanter's place at Excester, and,
I thinke, was certainly minister of St. Laurence &lt;Jewry&gt;
church (quaere) in London.</p>

<p>Anno Domini 166&lt;1&gt;, the deane of Exon dyed, and then
it was his right to step-in next to the deanry.</p>


<h4>&lt;<i>Becomes bishop of Exeter.</i>&gt;</h4>

<p>Anno Domini 1663, the bishop of Exon dyed: Dr. Ward,
the deane, was in Devonshire at that time, at ... (I thinke
'twas Taverstoke), at a visitation at ...,<a name="FNanchor_XCVII._188" id="FNanchor_XCVII._188"></a><a href="#Footnote_XCVII._188" class="fnanchor">[XCVII.]</a> where
were a great number of the gentrey of the
countrey. Deane Ward was very well knowne
to the gentry, and his learning, prudence, and
comity had wonne them<a name="FNanchor_1190_1399" id="FNanchor_1190_1399"></a><a href="#Footnote_1190_1399" class="fnanchor">[1190]</a> all to be his friends. The
newes of the death of the bishop being brought to them,
who were all very merry and rejoycing with good entertainment,
with great alacrity the gentlemen cryed all, <i>uno uno</i><a name="FNanchor_1191_1400" id="FNanchor_1191_1400"></a><a href="#Footnote_1191_1400" class="fnanchor">[1191]</a>,
'Wee will have Mr. Deane<a name="FNanchor_1192_1401" id="FNanchor_1192_1401"></a><a href="#Footnote_1192_1401" class="fnanchor">[1192]</a> to be our Bishop.' This was
at that criticall time when the House of Commons were the
king's darlings. The deane told them that for his part he
had no interest or acquaintance at Court; but intimated to
them how much the king esteemed the members of parliament
(and a great many Parliament men were then there),
and that his majestie would deny them nothing. 'If 'tis
so, gentlemen' (sayd Mr. Deane), 'that you will needes
have me to be your bishop, if some of you make your
addresse to his majestie, 'twill be donne.'&mdash;With
that they<a name="FNanchor_XCVIII._189" id="FNanchor_XCVIII._189"></a><a href="#Footnote_XCVIII._189" class="fnanchor">[XCVIII.]</a> dranke the other glasse, a health
to the king, and another to their wished-for
bishop; had their horses presently made ready, putt
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>foot in stirrup, and away they rode merrily to London;
went to the king, and he immediately graunted them
their request. This is the first time that ever a bishop was
made by the House of Commons. Now, though envy
cannot deny, that this worthy person was very well worthy
any preferment could be conferred on him, yet the old
bishops (e.g. Humphrey &lt;Henchman&gt;, bishop of London;
John Cosins, bishop of Durham; etc.)<a name="FNanchor_1193_1402" id="FNanchor_1193_1402"></a><a href="#Footnote_1193_1402" class="fnanchor">[1193]</a> were exceedingly
disgruntled at it, to see a briske young bishop that could
see through all their formall gravity, but 40 yeares old, not
come in at the right dore but leape over the pale. It went
to their very hearts. Well, bishop of Excester he was, to
the great joy of all the diocese<a name="FNanchor_1194_1403" id="FNanchor_1194_1403"></a><a href="#Footnote_1194_1403" class="fnanchor">[1194]</a>. Being bishop he had then
free accesse to his majestie, who is a lover of ingenuity and
a discerner of ingeniose men, and quickly tooke a liking to
him.</p>

dyed, and then he was made bishop of Sarum, mense &lt;Sept.&gt;</p>


<h4>&lt;<i>Personal characteristics.</i>&gt;</h4>

<p>He is (without all manner of flattery) so prudent, learned,
and good a man, that he honours his preferment as much
as the preferment does him; and is such a one that cannot
be advanced too high. My lord (Lucius) Falkland was
wont to say that he never knew any one that a paire of
lawne sleeves had not altered from himselfe, but only
bishop Juxon; had he knowne this excellent prelate, he
would have sayd he had knowne one more. As he is the
pattern of humility and courtesie, so he knowes when to
be severe and austere; and he is not one to be trampled
or worked upon. He is a batchelour, and of a most
magnificent and munificent mind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span></p>

<p>He hath been a benefactor to the Royall Societie, (of
which he was one of the first members and
institutors<a name="FNanchor_XCIX._190" id="FNanchor_XCIX._190"></a><a href="#Footnote_XCIX._190" class="fnanchor">[XCIX.]</a>), gave them, Anno Domini ... <i>li.</i>
He also gave a noble pendulum clock to the
Royall Societie (which goes a weeke), to perpetuate<a name="FNanchor_1198_1407" id="FNanchor_1198_1407"></a><a href="#Footnote_1198_1407" class="fnanchor">[1198]</a>
the memory of his deare and learned

<p>Quaere, was the bishop ever professor at Gresham
College?</p>

<p>He gave anno 167-, ... <i>li.</i> towards the making of the
river at Salisbury navigable to Christ Church. Anno 1679
he gave to Sydney Colledge a thousand pounds.</p>

<p>He haz perused all the records of the Church of Sarum,
which, with long lyeing, had been conglutinated together;
read them all over, and taken abridgements of them, which
haz not been donne by any of his predecessors I beleeve
for some hundreds of yeares.</p>

<p>He had an admirable habit of body (athletique, which
was a fault), a handsome man, pleasant and sanguine; he
did not desire to have his wisdome be judged by the
gravity of his beard, but his prudence and ratiotination.
This, methinkes, is strange to consider in him, that being
a great student (and that of mathematiques and difficult
knotty points, which does use to make men unfit for
businesse), he is so cleare and ready, as no sollicitor is
more adroit for looking after affaires.</p>

<h3><b>Walter Warner</b> (15&mdash;- 1640).</h3>


<p><a name="FNanchor_1210_1419" id="FNanchor_1210_1419"></a><a href="#Footnote_1210_1419" class="fnanchor">[1210]</a>From Dr. John Pell:&mdash;Mr Walter Warner:&mdash;his
youngest brother was High Sheriff of Leicestershire, about
1642. He and his brother dyed both batchelors. Dr. Pell
haz seen him that was sheriff; but was well acquainted
with Walter. The estate came to a middle brother, a
lame man.</p>

<p>Walter had but one hand (borne so), he thinks a right
hand; his mother was frighted, which caused this deformity,
so that instead of a left hand, he had only a stump with
five warts upon it, instead of a hand and fingers. He wore
a cuffe on it like a pockett. The Doctor never sawe his
stump, but Mr. Warner's man<a name="FNanchor_1211_1420" id="FNanchor_1211_1420"></a><a href="#Footnote_1211_1420" class="fnanchor">[1211]</a> has told him so.</p>

<p>This Walter Warner was both mathematician and philosopher,
and 'twas he that putt-out Thomas Hariot's Algebra,
though he mentions it not.</p>

<p>Mr. Warner did tell Dr. Pell, that when Dr. Harvey
came out with his Circulation of the Blood, he did wonder
whence Dr. Harvey had it: but comeing one day to the
earle of Leicester, he found Dr. Harvey in the hall, talking
very familiarly with Mr. Prothero (<i>Wallic&egrave;</i> ap Roderic),
to whom Mr. Warner had discoursed concerning this
exercitation of his <i>De Circulatione Sanguinis</i>, and made
no question but Dr. Harvey had his <i>hint</i> from Prothero.
Memorandum:&mdash;Dr. Pell sayes that Mr. Warner rationated
demonstratively by beates of the pulses that there must be
a circulation of the blood.</p>

<p>When Mr. Hariot dyed, he made Sir Thomas Alesbury
and Mr. Prothero his executors, by which meanes his
papers came to be divided into two hands. Those which
fell to Sir Thomas Alesbury, fell, after his death, to
his sonne-in-lawe, Edward, earle of Clarendon, Lord
Chancellor, and in his sonne's hands (this present, 1680,
earle of Clarendon) 'tis beleeved are those that are
yet left; none of them were printed, save that <i>Artis</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span><i>Analyticae Praxis</i>, which was printed by Mr. Warner upon
this occasion, viz. Sir Thomas Alesbury obtained of
Algernon, earle of Northumberland (son to that earle,
prisoner in the Tower), a continuation of the annuity,
dureing Warner's life, upon condition that he should,
out of Mr. Hariot's papers, drawe out some piece fitt
to be published<a name="FNanchor_1212_1421" id="FNanchor_1212_1421"></a><a href="#Footnote_1212_1421" class="fnanchor">[1212]</a>, which he did, under the title aforesayd,
in folio, 1631, London: but did not sett his name to
it, and accordingly Warner had his money as long as he
lived. The other part of Mr. Hariot's papers, which were
in Mr. Prothero's keeping, came to the hands of the lord
John Vaughan, eldest son to the earle of Carbery, lately
governor of Jamaica, which vide.</p>

<p>Mr. Warner's youngest brother was a good husband and
an industrious man, and would say that had he so much
money, he could improve it to very great advantage;
wherupon his eldest brother (Walter) did lett him sell
his land, by which meanes he did so improve his estate
by graseing, etc. that he became High Sheriff as aforesaid
(quaere of the attorneys when). Dr. Pell has seen him,
and spake with him.</p>

<p>Mr. Walter Warner made an Inverted Logarithmicall
Table, i.e. whereas Briggs's table fills his margin with
numbers encreasing by unites, and over-against them setts
their logarithms, which because of incommensurability must
needs &lt;be&gt; either abundant or deficient; Mr. Warner (like
a dictionary of the Latine before the English) fills the
margin with logarithmes encreasing by unites, and<a name="FNanchor_1213_1422" id="FNanchor_1213_1422"></a><a href="#Footnote_1213_1422" class="fnanchor">[1213]</a> setts<a name="FNanchor_C._195" id="FNanchor_C._195"></a><a href="#Footnote_C._195" class="fnanchor">[C.]</a>
to every one of them so many continuall
meane proportionalls between 1 and 10<a name="FNanchor_1214_1423" id="FNanchor_1214_1423"></a><a href="#Footnote_1214_1423" class="fnanchor">[1214]</a>, and
they for the same reason must also have the
last figure incompleat. These, after the death of Mr. Warner,
came to the hands of Mr. Herbert Thorndyke, prebendary
of Westminster, and by him left in the hands of Dr. Richard
Busby, schoolmaster and prebendary of Westminster, which,
before Mr. John Pell grew acquainted with Mr. Warner,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>were ten thousand, and at Mr. Warner's request were by
Mr. Pell's hands, or direction, made a hundred thousand.
The difference of the hands will shew the workman's
in the originalls, which Dr. Busby haz.</p>

<p>The bishop thinkes he was of Cambridge university, but
is not certaine. Dr. Pell believes that he was of no

Logarithmes? for W. Warner would not doe such a thing

John Whitson was borne at Cover in the Forest of Deane
in the countie of Glocester. He went to schoole at Bristow,
where he made a good proficience in the Latin tongue. He
was bound apprentice to alderman Vawr, a Spanish merchant
of this city. He was a handsome young fellow; and his
old master the alderman being dead, his mistress one day
called him into the wine-cellar and bad him broach the
best butt in the cellar for her.... His mistresse after
maried him. This story will last perhaps as long as
Bristol is a city.</p>

<p>He had a good naturall witt, and gaind by the Spanish
trade a fair estate.</p>

<p>His second wife was ... the daughter of ... Hine,
alderman of London, a very beautifull dame, as by her
picture, at length, in the dining rome, doeth appear. By
her he had a daughter, his only child, who was counted the
flower of Bristol, who was maried to Sir Thomas Trenchard
of Dorsetshire, who dyeing (together with her child), the
alderman gave him compensation for the mannour of
Dunderhill<a name="FNanchor_1233_1442" id="FNanchor_1233_1442"></a><a href="#Footnote_1233_1442" class="fnanchor">[1233]</a> and had it again.</p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></div>

<p>His third wife was ... by whom he had no issue. His
fourth and last wife was Rachel, daughter of Richard
Danvers of Tokenham, Wilts, esq., relict of John Aubrey
of Burleton in the county of Hereford, esq. (my father
Richard Aubrey being then eleaven yeares of age). He had
no issue by her. The alderman made him<a name="FNanchor_1234_1443" id="FNanchor_1234_1443"></a><a href="#Footnote_1234_1443" class="fnanchor">[1234]</a> a good
falkoner, but did cutt downe his woods and never made him
any satisfaction: but lett his good workes be sett in balance
against it.</p>

<p>He lived nobly; kept a plentifull table; and was the
most popular magistrate<a name="FNanchor_1235_1444" id="FNanchor_1235_1444"></a><a href="#Footnote_1235_1444" class="fnanchor">[1235]</a> in the city, alwaies chosen
a member of Parliament. He kept a noble house, and did
entertain and treat the peers and great persons that came
to the city. He kept his hawkes.</p>

<p>I remember five that had been bred-up under him, but
not one of them came to good, they lived so luxuriously,
just as the servants of Sir John Robinson, governor of the
Tower.</p>

<p>He had a very good healthy constitution, and was an
early riser; wrote all his letters and dispatched his businesse
betime in the morning.</p>

<p>He was charitable in his life in breeding-up of poor
scholars: particularly I remember William Haywood, D.D.,
whome he preferred to St. John's Colledge in Oxon,
where are<a name="FNanchor_1236_1445" id="FNanchor_1236_1445"></a><a href="#Footnote_1236_1445" class="fnanchor">[1236]</a> certaine Bristowe fellowships. His father was
a cowper in Ballance Street; his mother, whom I well
remember, was a midwife in the city.</p>

<p>He had a fair<a name="FNanchor_1237_1446" id="FNanchor_1237_1446"></a><a href="#Footnote_1237_1446" class="fnanchor">[1237]</a> house in St. Nicholas Street, where is the
stateliest dining roome in the city. He had been thrice
mayor of this city, as is to be seen in the table of mayors
in St. Nicholas Street in golden letters.</p>

<p>His beloved and only daughter dyeing, and so being
<i>orbus</i>, Richard Wheeler his nephew, who was bred a merchant
under him with others, was his heir; but he proving
a sott and a capricious coxcombe, he setled all his estate
upon the city of Bristow for pious uses, and was, I doe
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>believe, the greatest benefactor that ever the city had. He
gave the mannour of Durdery and the mannour of Burnet
and divers houses in Bristowe.</p>

<p>He dyed about the seaventy-sixth yeare of his age by
a fall from his horse, his head pitching on a nail that stood
on its head by a smyth's shop. He was buried very
honourably<a name="FNanchor_1238_1447" id="FNanchor_1238_1447"></a><a href="#Footnote_1238_1447" class="fnanchor">[1238]</a>; besides all his relations in mourning, he had
as many poor old men (or men and woemen) as he was
yeares old in mourning gownes and hoodes, the mayor and
aldermen in mourning; all the trained band (he was their
colonel) attended the funerall and their pikes had black
ribons and drummes were covered with black cloath.</p>

<p>He lies interred in the west end of the 'Crowd' (the
name of the vault under all St. Nicholas Church, as St.
Faith's was under St. Paule's), where he lies in effigie on an
altar-monument of alabaster and marble. &#9758; See his

was a goldsmith in Oxford. Mr. Francis Potter knew him
very well, and was wont to say that he was a very ingeniose

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span><i>perpetuall motion</i>. He maryed a daughter of Mr. John
Dod (who wrote on the Commandments), at whose house,
at &lt;Fawlsley, near Daventry&gt;, Northamptonshire, she
laye-in with her son John, of whome we are now to
speake.</p>

<p>He had a brother (Timothy), squier-beadle of &lt;Divinity&gt;
in Oxford, and a uterine brother, Walter Pope, M.D.</p>

<p>He had his grammar learning in Oxford, (I thinke from
Mr. Sylvester). He was admitted of Magdalen-hall in
Oxford, &lt;1627&gt; (vide A. Wood's <i>Antiq. Oxon.</i>) His tutor
there was the learned Mr. John Tombs (Coryphaeus of the
Anabaptists). Anno Domini &lt;1631&gt; A.B.; Anno Domini
&lt;1634&gt; M.A. He read to pupils here, (among others,
Walter Charlton, M.D., was his pupill): he continued
here ... yeares.</p>

<p>He has sayd oftentimes that the first rise, or hint of his rising,
was from goeing accidentally a courseing of a hare: where
an ingeniose gentleman of good quality falling into discourse
with him, and finding him to have a very good witt<a name="FNanchor_1242_1451" id="FNanchor_1242_1451"></a><a href="#Footnote_1242_1451" class="fnanchor">[1242]</a>, told
him that he would never gett any considerable preferment
by continuing in the university; and that his best way was
to betake himselfe to some lord's or great person's house<a name="FNanchor_1243_1452" id="FNanchor_1243_1452"></a><a href="#Footnote_1243_1452" class="fnanchor">[1243]</a>
that had good benefices to conferre. Sayd Mr. J. Wilkins,
'I am not knowne in the world; I know not to whom to
addresse myselfe upon such a designe.' The gentleman
replied, 'I will recommend you myselfe,' and did so, to (as
I thinke) lord viscount Say and Seale (quaere), where he
stayed with very good likeing till the late civill warres, and
then he was chaplain to his highnesse &lt;Charles Louis&gt;
Prince Elector Palatine of the Rhine, with whom he went
(after the peace<a name="FNanchor_CI._197" id="FNanchor_CI._197"></a><a href="#Footnote_CI._197" class="fnanchor">[CI.]</a> concluded in Germany<a name="FNanchor_1244_1453" id="FNanchor_1244_1453"></a><a href="#Footnote_1244_1453" class="fnanchor">[1244]</a>),
and was well preferred there by his highnesse.

<p>After the Visitation at Oxon by the Parliament, he gott
to be Warden of Wadham Colledge. Anno &lt;1656&gt; maried
to &lt;Robina&gt; the relict of Dr. &lt;Peter&gt; French, canon of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>Christchurch, Oxon, and sister to Oliver, (then) Lord

Colledge in Cambridge, (in which place he revived learning
by strickt examinations at elections: he was much honoured
there, and heartily loved by all;) where he continued till
1660, (the restauration of his majestie). Then he was
minister of Saint Laurence &lt;Jewry&gt; church in London; and
anno ... was deane of Rippon in Yorkeshire. His friend,
Seth Ward, D.D., being made bishop of Excester, he was
made there deane, and anno 166&lt;8&gt; by the favour of
George, duke of Buckingham, was made bishop<a name="FNanchor_1246_1455" id="FNanchor_1246_1455"></a><a href="#Footnote_1246_1455" class="fnanchor">[1246]</a> of
Chester; and was extremely well beloved in his diocese.
Anno Domini &lt;1672&gt; he dyed of &lt;the stone&gt;. He left
a legacy of four hundred pounds (quaere) to the Royall
Society, and had he been able would have given more.
He was no great read man; but one of much and deepe
thinking, and of a working head; and a prudent man as
well as ingeniose. He was one of Seth, lord bishop of
Sarum's most intimate friends. He was a lustie, strong
growne, well sett, broad shoulderd person, cheerfull, and
hospitable.</p>

<p>He was the principall reviver of experimentall philosophy
(secundum mentem domini Baconi) at Oxford, where he
had weekely an experimentall philosophicall clubbe, which
began 1649, and was the incunabula of the Royall Society.
When he came to London, they mett at the Bull-head
taverne in Cheapside, (e.g. 1658, 1659, and after), till it
grew to big for a clubb, and so they came to Gresham
colledge parlour.</p>

<p>1647 and 1648 (quaere, if not +), kept Abingdon-market<a name="FNanchor_1253_1462" id="FNanchor_1253_1462"></a><a href="#Footnote_1253_1462" class="fnanchor">[1253]</a>,
and Dr. &lt;Richard&gt; Lydall and he had a horse
between them: this was before a Doctor<a name="FNanchor_1254_1463" id="FNanchor_1254_1463"></a><a href="#Footnote_1254_1463" class="fnanchor">[1254]</a>. He grew
more and more into good practise.</p>

<p>He studied chymistry in Peckwater Inne chamber<a name="FNanchor_1255_1464" id="FNanchor_1255_1464"></a><a href="#Footnote_1255_1464" class="fnanchor">[1255]</a>. He
was in those dayes very mathematicall, and I have
heard him say his genius lay more to mathematics then
chymistry.</p>

<p>His father was steward to Sir John (I thinke) Smyth<a name="FNanchor_1256_1465" id="FNanchor_1256_1465"></a><a href="#Footnote_1256_1465" class="fnanchor">[1256]</a>;
and had a little estate at Ivy Hinksey, where my lady
Smyth (vidua) dyed.</p>

<p>He went to schoole to Mr. &lt;Edward&gt; Sylvester in Oxon,
over the meadowes, where he ayred his muse, and made
good exercise:&mdash;from William Hawes, his schoolefellow.
Anno about 1657 (quaere there), riding towards Brackley
to a patient, his way led him thorough Astrop, where he
observed the stones in the little rill were discoloured of a kind
of <i>Crocus Martis</i> colour; thought he, this may be an indication
of iron; he getts gaules, and putts some of the powder
into the water, and immediately it turned blackish; then
sayd he, 'I'le not send my patients now so far as Tunbridge,'
and so he in a short time<a name="FNanchor_1257_1466" id="FNanchor_1257_1466"></a><a href="#Footnote_1257_1466" class="fnanchor">[1257]</a> brought these waters into vogue,
and hath inriched a poore obscure village. He was middle
stature: darke red<a name="FNanchor_1258_1467" id="FNanchor_1258_1467"></a><a href="#Footnote_1258_1467" class="fnanchor">[1258]</a> haire (like a red pig): stammered
much.</p>

<p>He was first servitor to Dr. &lt;Thomas&gt; Iles, one of the
canons of X<sup>t</sup>. Ch. whose wife was a knowing woman in
physique and surgery, and did many cures. Tom Willis
then wore a blew livery-cloak, and studied at the lower end
of the hall, by the hall-dore; was pretty handy, and his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>mistresse would oftentimes have him to assist her in making
of medicines. This did him no hurt, and allured him on.</p>

&lt;Burford&gt;; was of Wadham College, Oxford; I suppose,
had been in France.</p>

<p>About 18, he stole his lady, &lt;Elizabeth&gt; Malet, a daughter
and heir, a great fortune; for which I remember I sawe
him a prisoner in the Tower about 1662.</p>

<p>His youthly spirit and oppulent fortune did sometimes
make him doe extravagant actions, but in the country he
was generally civill enough. He was wont to say that
when he came to Brentford the devill entred into him and
never left him till he came into the country again to
Alderbury or Woodstock.</p>

<p>He was raunger of Woodstock-parke and lived often at
the lodge at the west end, a very delightfull place and
noble prospect westwards. Here his lordship had severall
lascivious pictures drawen.</p>

<p>His lordship read all manner of bookes. Mr. Andrew
Marvell, who was a good judge of witt, was wont to say
that he was the best English satyrist and had the right veine.
'Twas pitty death tooke him off so soon.</p>

<p>In his last sicknesse he was exceedingly paenitent and
wrote a lettre of his repentance to Dr. Burnet, which is
printed.</p>

<p>He sent for all his servants, even the piggard-boy, to come
and heare his palinode<a name="FNanchor_1260_1469" id="FNanchor_1260_1469"></a><a href="#Footnote_1260_1469" class="fnanchor">[1260]</a>. He dyed at Woodstock-parke,
26 July, 1680; and buried at Spilsbury in the same countie,

was borne at Bentworth, near Alton, in Hantshire, on the
eleaventh of June, 1588.</p>

<p>He maried Elizabeth, eldest daughter of H. Emerson, of
South Lambeth, in com. Surrey, esqre, whose ancestors
lye entombed in the choeur of St. Savior's, Southwark,
neer the monument of bishop Andrewes, with a statue of
white marble. She was a great witt, and would write in
verse too.</p>

<p>He was of &lt;Magdalen College&gt; in Oxford. He would
make verses as fast as he could write them. And though
he was an easie rymer, and no good poet, he was a good
<i>vates</i>. He had a strange sagacity and foresight into
mundane affaires.</p>

<p>He was an early observator of <i>Quicquid agunt homines</i>;
his witt was satyricall. I thinke the first thing he wrote
was 'Abuses whipt and stript,' for which he was committed
prisoner to ...<a name="FNanchor_1265_1474" id="FNanchor_1265_1474"></a><a href="#Footnote_1265_1474" class="fnanchor">[1265]</a> (I beleeve, Newgate). I believe 'twas
tempore Jacobi regis. He was a captain in the Parliament
army, and the Parliament gave him for his service
Mr. John Denham's estate at Egham, in Surrey. The
motto of his colours was, <i>Pro Rege, Lege, Grege</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span></p>

<p>After the restauration of his majestie he was imprisoned
in the Tower about three quarters of a yeare. He died
the 2d of May, 1667, and lieth interred within the east
dore of the Savoy church, where he dyed. He was pupill

days, hoped for some official post. On a slip pasted to fol. 27<sup>v</sup> of MS. Aubr.
9 is this note:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
'Mr. Secretary Wren's indefinite (?) kindnesse is valuable if our lord P.

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_CY_206" id="Footnote_CY_206"></a><a href="#FNanchor_CY_206"><span class="label">[CY]</span></a> Aubrey was anxious to obtain the exact date as an item towards his pet
astrological collection. But he fancied that Wren had played a trick on him,
by taking the place of a brother of the same name, one year younger, who died
in infancy. Aubrey might have reflected that, while it is possible that parents
might give the name of a deceased child to their next, the other course is unlikely.
The following excerpts from Aubrey's letters to Anthony Wood bear
on the point:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
(a) Nov. 17, 1670: MS. Wood F. 39, fol. 128:&mdash;'Dr. Christopher Wren
was borne at &lt;East&gt; Knoyle, baptized the 10th day of November 1631. I have
writt to him for the exact time, astrologiae ergo: 'tis a poore-spirited thing, if
he will not resolve me.'
</p>
<p>
(b) Jan. 16, 1671/2: MS. Wood F. 39, fol. 160<sup>v</sup>:&mdash;'Dr. Christopher Wren ...
tells me he was borne at ... Knahill 20 October, 1631. He was a second
Christopher: &lt;the one&gt; whome I sent to you was the first.'
</p>
<p>
(c) Feb. 1, 1671/2: MS. Wood F. 39, fol. 165:&mdash;'Dr. Christopher Wren hath
putt a trick on us, as it seemes; for he hath made him selfe a yeare younger
then indeed he is, though he needs not be ashamed of his age, he hath made
such admirable use of his time. I mett t'other day accidentally with the
parson of Knahill, who justifies the register, and not only so but proves it by
his neighbour that was his nurse and her son that suckled with him&mdash;evidence
notorious. 'Tis true, as the Doctor sayes, that there were two Christophers,

<p>Certain errors in navigation detected and corrected by
Edward Wright, with many additions that were not in the
former edition as appeareth in the next pages, London, 1610.</p>

<p>It is dedicated to the high and mighty Henry, prince of
Wales, etc. In the Epistle dedicatory he makes mention
of a goodlye and royall ship that his highnesse lately built,
and that since his highnesse comeing into England that the
'art of navigation hath been much advanced here as well
in searching the North-east and North-west passages as
also in discovering the sea-coastes and inland of Virginea,
Newfoundland, Groenland, and of the North New-land as far
as Hackluyt's headland, within 9 degrees of the pole, also
of Guiana and divers parts and ilands of the East Indies,
yea, and some parts also of the south continent discovered
by Sir Richard Hawkins.'</p>

<p>He read mathematicks to Prince Henry; and Sir Jonas
Moore had the wooden sphaere in the Tower, which was
contrived by Mr. Wright for the more easy information of
the prince.</p>

<p>three sheetes, of his owne hand-writing, in folio. I deposited
it in the Royal Society, but Mr. R. Hooke saieth that it is
printed in a booke by it selfe, which see.</p>

<p>In his preface to the reader he sayes that 'the errors
I have in the following treatise laboured to reforme to the
utmost (yea, rather beyond the utmost) of my poor abilitie,
neglecting in the meane time other studies and courses that
might have been more beneficial to me: which may argue
my good will to have proceeded further to the amendment of
such other faults and imperfections as yet remain besides
those alreadie specified.'</p>

<p>It appeares by his preface that his worth was attended
by a great deal of envie.</p>

<p><i>Ibid.</i>&mdash;He was in the voyage of the right honourable

the seaman's rings for the present finding out both of the
variation of the needle and time of the day at one instant
without any farther trouble of using any other instrument,
and hath farther shewed how by the sun's point of the compasse
(or magnetical azimuth) and altitude given by observation
the variation may be found either mechanically with
ruler and compasse or mathematically by the doctrine of
triangles and arithmeticall calculation.'</p>

<p>John Collins &lt;says that&gt; he happened upon the logarithmes

<h2>APPENDIX I<br />

NOTES OF ANTIQUITIES</h2>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&lt;Here and there in the <i>Lives</i> Aubrey has jotted down notes on
various matters of antiquarian interest. These are collected here,
and a few other notes of the same type from other Aubrey volumes
added to them. Aubrey attached to some of these notes the title of
'Nouvelles,' e.g. MS. Aubr. 8, foll. 6, 28<sup>v</sup>, 103.&gt;</p></div>


<p>&lt;<i>'Sir' = dominus</i>.&gt; I remember, before the late warres,
the ministers in Herefordshire, etc. (counties that way), had
the title of <i>S<sup>r</sup>.</i>, as the bachalours of Art<a name="FNanchor_1301_1510" id="FNanchor_1301_1510"></a><a href="#Footnote_1301_1510" class="fnanchor">[1301]</a> have at Oxon,
as 'Sir Richard, of Stretford,' 'Sir William, of Monkland.'
And so it was in Wilts, when my grandfather Lyte was
a boy; and anciently everywhere. The example of this
appeares in the excellent comoedie of <i>The Scornfull Ladie</i>,
where 'Sir Roger' (the chaplain) has a great part. It was
made by Mr. J. Fletcher about the beginning of King
James' time; but in all old wills before the reformation it
is upon record.&mdash;MS. Aubr. 3, fol. 30.</p>

<p>&lt;<i>Ghost-stories.</i>&gt; When I was a child, and so before the
civill warres, the fashion was for old women and maydes to
tell fabulous stories, night-&lt;t&gt;imes, and of sprights and
walking of ghosts, etc. This was derived downe from
mother to daughter, etc., from the monkish ballance, which
upheld holy Church: for the divines say 'Deny spirits, and
you are an atheist.' When the warres came, and with
them liberty of conscience and liberty of inquisition, the
phantomes vanish. Now children feare no such things,
having heard not of them, and are not checked<a name="FNanchor_1303_1512" id="FNanchor_1303_1512"></a><a href="#Footnote_1303_1512" class="fnanchor">[1303]</a> with such

hangings, viz. of Edward the Fourth's time, in which is
described the invention and use of gunnes. The muskets
there are only a long tube stop't at one end, with a touch-hole,
and fitted to a long staff. This gun one holds on
a rest and aimes; and then another comes with a lighted
match in a stick and gives fire, so that 'twas the worke of
two men then to manage one piece. Till the late warres
refined locksmiths' worke, I remember when I was boy

did see one that spake of a woman towards the farther end
of Cornwall that could speak no English)&mdash;but they still
retaine their ancient way of pronunciation, which is with a

in my remembrance, before the civill warres, copyholders

people, that are upon almes, have it. In Herefordshire,
Monmouth, Salop, etc., it is so still. But now this yeare
(1671) are goeing up no lesse then 3 glasse-howses between
Glocester and about Worcester, so that glasse will be
common over all England.&mdash;MS. Aubr. 21, fol. 95<sup>v</sup>.</p>

<h2>APPENDIX II<br />

AUBREY'S COMEDY OF RESTORATION MANNERS</h2>


<div class="blockquot">

<p>&lt;While hiding from the bailiffs in 1671 at Broad Chalk, Aubrey (see
i. 52) set himself to compose a comedy descriptive of country life as
he had seen it, abating nothing of its grossness, and concealing
nothing of its immorality. The rude draft of this comedy is found in
MS. Aubrey 21, written in the blank spaces and between the lines of
a long legal document.</p>

<p>Although few of the scenes are sketched, and fewer completed, it is
possible to form an idea of the scope and plot of the piece.</p>

<p>The jumbling together of all classes of society in the rude merriment
of a country wake was designed to bring out the follies and vices of
them all. A few gentlemen and ladies of the old school, of courtly
manners and decent carriage, were brought in to set out by contrast
the boorishness, the insolence, and the mad drunken bouts of Aubrey's
contemporaries. A mixed company of sow-gelders, carters, dairy-maids,
gypsies, were to give evidence, in dialogue and song, of the
coarse talk and the vile ideas of the vulgar. And a still more disreputable
rout of squires who had left their wives and taken up with
cook-maids, and of heiresses who had run away with grooms, was to
exemplify the degradation of the gentry. In several cases, over the
names of his <i>Dramatis Personae</i>, Aubrey has jotted the names or
initials of the real persons he was copying.</p>

<p>The plot was to have a double movement; on the one hand, the
innocent loves of a boy and girl of gentle birth, living in disguise as
shepherd and dairy-maid, the 'Lord and Lady of the Maypole,' and,
on the other hand, the fortunes of an adulteress, pursued by her
husband, following her paramour in page's attire, jealous of his attentions
to other women, ending in murder all round&mdash;'Raynes<a name="FNanchor_1356_1565" id="FNanchor_1356_1565"></a><a href="#Footnote_1356_1565" class="fnanchor">[1356]</a> comes
and invades Sir Fastidious Overween, and is slayne by him; and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>then Sir Fastidious neglects her; she comes and stabbes him, and
then herselfe.'</p>

<p>The scene, on the title-page, is laid, for a blind, at 'Aldford in
Cheshire, by the river Dee, St. Peters day, 1669'; but in act i, scene
1, Aubrey, laying pretence aside, places it on 'Christian Malford
green' in his own district in Wiltshire, near Kington St. Michael,
Draycot Cerne, etc.</p>

<p>Taken as a whole, both in what is written out and in the anecdotes
collected to be worked into the plot, the comedy affords a terrible
picture of the corruption of Aubrey's county and times. It may be
compared with the society pictures in Anne Bront&euml;'s <i>The Tenant of
Wildfell Hall</i>.</p>

<p>Two scenes, of the less offensive ones, may serve to give a faint idea
of this curious piece of seventeenth century realism.&gt;</p></div>

<b>Act II, scene iii.</b></h3>


<div class="directcenter">

<p>A faire roome. Enter Sir Eglamour, Lady Euphrasia, Lady
Pamela: to them, Sir Eubule Nestor; then, squire Fitz-ale.</p></div>

<p><i>Sir J. Fitz-ale.</i> Sir Eglamour, your most humble
servant.</p>

<p><i>Sir Eglamour.</i> Sir John Fitz-ale, the welcomest man
alive.</p>

<p><i>Fitz-ale.</i> Save you, ladies! I'm come to wayte on you
at the famous revell here, to help celebrate the festivall of
St. Peter.</p>

<p><i>Ladyes.</i> Most kindly donne, Sir John! We heard you
strictly kept his virgil last night at Justice Wagstaff's.</p>

<p><i>Fitz-ale.</i> So strickt that none of us have been a-bed
to-night, that's the trueth on't. I beleeve, since the
Conquest, St. Peter had never a merrier eve observed.</p>

<p><i>Ladyes.</i> Pray, Sir John, favour us to let us heare some
of the mirth.</p>

<p><i>Fitz-ale.</i> Why, ladies, yesterday we Cheshire gentlemen
mett at a barrell of ale at the bull-ring where we sufficiently
bayted both bull and barrell; and having well dranke
there, staved and tayled, till 5 a-clock i' th' afternoon, wee<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>
were invited to the Justice's; where being come into the
great hall wee mett for a good omen the servants labouring
at heaving into the cellar a teirce of French wine, newly
brought by the barge from Chester. Faith! we had
a frolique, and voted it (<i>nemine contradicente</i>) to have itt
sett abroach in the midest of the hall. To worke we goe,
and we four knights mount the tierce, bestride it, like the
<i>quarter files</i><a name="FNanchor_1358_1567" id="FNanchor_1358_1567"></a><a href="#Footnote_1358_1567" class="fnanchor">[1358]</a> <i>d'Amond</i> upon one horse. Then we dranke
his Majestie's health, the Queen's, and the royall family:
then, faire ladies, (<i>he bowes</i>) your two healths; then, our
mistresses: then, God knows who&mdash;till the cooke knockt for
supper. So the tierce was reprieved till after supper, a
guard sett over it. As wee were going to sitt downe to
supper in the parlour a sudden quarrell arose between Sir
Fastidious Overween and Captain Quarelsome about
precedency. To cuffs they fell, all in confusion; the
ladies cryed out, Sir Fastidious' great periwig was throwne
into the fire and made an abominable stinke.</p>

<p><i>Sir Eubule</i><a name="FNanchor_1359_1568" id="FNanchor_1359_1568"></a><a href="#Footnote_1359_1568" class="fnanchor">[1359]</a>. Blesse me! What unheard of rudenesse!
This to be donne at a gentleman's house and by gentlemen,
senators, parliamentary justices of the peace!</p>

<p><i>Sir J. Fitz-ale.</i> In this scuffle the chiape of Capt.
Quarelsome's sword hitcht in the cubboard of glasses:
downe came all the glasses of the butler with a most
dreadfull esclate. But this is not all&mdash;the cross-bar<a name="FNanchor_1360_1569" id="FNanchor_1360_1569"></a><a href="#Footnote_1360_1569" class="fnanchor">[1360]</a> of
Sir Fastidious' sword hitchd in my old ladie's vaile and
pluckt it off, together with her periwig, and showed her
poor bald old death's head.</p>

<p><i>Sir Eubule.</i> Lord blesse me!</p>

<p><i>Sir J. Fitz-ale.</i> The Justice and I struck in between
'em and parted 'em, and, with something more trouble then
staving and tayling dog and bull<a name="FNanchor_1361_1570" id="FNanchor_1361_1570"></a><a href="#Footnote_1361_1570" class="fnanchor">[1361]</a>, they were reconciled
and sate down opposite to each other. To a noble supper
we sate downe.</p>

<p>After supper desert was brought. My country gentlemen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>catcht and snatchd like schoolboies and gobbt up the
sweetmeats like ducks, and.... And being very drunke,
some putt even marmalade into their pocketts. A noble
carpet in the parlour trayled on the ground, which with
their dirty bootes they made the faire edge and bordure as
dirty as a woman's saddlecloth.</p>

<p>Supper being ended, faith! the justice would have the
tother bout at the butt for a confirmation of friendship<a name="FNanchor_1362_1571" id="FNanchor_1362_1571"></a><a href="#Footnote_1362_1571" class="fnanchor">[1362]</a>
between the two antagonists. I could not refuse to help
carry on such a good worke of charity. So we drank
friendly on till 2 a-clock i' th' morning. By that time you
may well thinke our braines were well warmd. We sung<a name="FNanchor_1363_1572" id="FNanchor_1363_1572"></a><a href="#Footnote_1363_1572" class="fnanchor">[1363]</a>,
hooped, hallowd, jubilled&mdash;set the cennell of hounds all in
a larum. We had the wenches and all the servants of the
house to participate in the great jubilee.</p>

<p>Well, about daybrake 'twas the generall vote for the
unhinging of the cellar dore and throwe it from the precipice
of the cliffe into the Dee. The good old dore, that
haz turnd on his hinges for these two centuries of yeares
in the dayes of his hospitable ancestors, was taken downe,
and by four tall fellowes borne to the cliffe. Hautboies<a name="FNanchor_1364_1573" id="FNanchor_1364_1573"></a><a href="#Footnote_1364_1573" class="fnanchor">[1364]</a>
loud musique playd before; the bearers followed; and then
came the chiefe mourners, the butler, brewer, and pantler,
weeping with blubbered eies for the decease of that had
turnd out and doubled in the dayes of his hospitable
ancestors:&mdash;'it was an ill omen<a name="FNanchor_1365_1574" id="FNanchor_1365_1574"></a><a href="#Footnote_1365_1574" class="fnanchor">[1365]</a> of the fall of that ancient
family.'</p>

<p><i>Sir Eubule.</i> And they sayd well. I knew their Justice's
grandfather and great grandfather too. &lt;They&gt; kept 12
men in blew coates and badges. We had no such doings
in their daies. They were sober, prudent; kept good well-ordered
hospitality. We are like to have a fine world
when Parliament men and Justices shall give such lewd
example....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Fitz-ale.</i> Well! after the mourners, we came with our
levetts<a name="FNanchor_1366_1575" id="FNanchor_1366_1575"></a><a href="#Footnote_1366_1575" class="fnanchor">[1366]</a> and clarions. Then the rest. We had the sowgelder
there, who loud performes the thorow-base. The
dogges tooke it in turne too along the river into Chester,
and sett all the dogges there barkeing.</p>

<p><i>Ladies.</i> I warrant the country people thought you
mad&mdash;</p>

<p>(<i>Sir Eubule</i><a name="FNanchor_1367_1576" id="FNanchor_1367_1576"></a><a href="#Footnote_1367_1576" class="fnanchor">[1367]</a>: And well they might, by my troth!)</p>
